“I have worked with Nancy Pelosi in Congress, and I have clashed with Nancy Pelosi as White House Chief of Staff. I know a tough negotiator when I see one, and I have the utmost respect for Leader Pelosi and her strengths. As we prepare to head into one of the most consequential Congresses in modern history, and one of the most important presidential elections in American history, this is no time to have a rookie sitting across the table from Mitch McConnell or Donald Trump or both. Nancy Pelosi is as tough and cagey as McConnell is ruthless and Trump is unprincipled. It is time for a Speaker that can go toe-to-toe with both of them in support of Democratic values. Rookies need not apply. Let’s keep our eye on the prize.”
