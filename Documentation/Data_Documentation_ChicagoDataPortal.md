The purpose of this portal is to make publically available all information that the city collects on its services and residents since this is information within the public domain. 

### Semantic Contents

###### What is Contained in this Dataset?

- The four files that are included in this geospatial data encompass a dataset that is intended to be used with map-based visualization tools. These files draw the boundary lines between Chicago Community Areas so that these divisions may be associated with my own data and visualized in a way that communicates how the data relates to different Chicago neighborhoods. 


### Collection Process

###### Scripts used for Data Collection

- None

###### Description of Data Collection

- These geospatial files took some searching to find, however, once I located them on the Chicago Data Portal all four of the files are easily downloaded as a one zip file. 

###### What do the 'Records' Represent?

- The data does not actually need to be opened and would be difficult to open because it is GIS data. The data does however contain information about coordinates and location data. For my purposes, I do not need to look at this data because Tableau directly reads in geospatial data. These files are ready made tools that map the city of Chicago.
