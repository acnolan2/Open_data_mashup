To work on the command line and use pip and all the other fun stuff for this project, you'll need to activate the conda
environment that works for this project. 

source activate Open_data_mashup

This will activate the conda env.

Then you'll need to cd into your folder, Documents/PyCharmProjects/Open_data_mashup

then jupyter notebooks as normal to launch that.
