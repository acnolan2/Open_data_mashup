2,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on County Legal Action Against Drug Manufacturers,“I commend Cook County| and counties across the area| for taking legal action to hold drug companies accountable for fueling the opioid epidemic. When Chicago led the charge against pharmaceutical companies for misleading marketing three years ago| our fight was a lonely one.

3,City Crackdown on Outlaw Party Bus Operators Results in 125 Tickets| 28 Cease and Desist Orders,As Chicago prepares to celebrate the New Year| a new City ordinance allowing regulators and Chicago police to crack down on illegal party buses while increasing safety requirements for licensed operators is showing promising results – and helping reduce crime. Since June 1| when the city implemented the new rules under an ordinance championed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel| regulators have issued 125 tickets and 28 cease and desist orders to noncompliant operators. Police have also made 11 illegal weapons and narcotics arrests under the new rules. At the same time| gun violence and drug crimes related to party buses have dropped throughout the city – making for a safer city and an improved consumer experience.  “The ordinance we passed this summer is showing progress|” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “The party is over for illegal party bus operators| and the parties are safer for people using licensed operators. I'm proud of the progress we have made to protect residents and visitors| and looking forward to building on our efforts in 2018." The strengthened rules| passed by the City Council this spring| helps improve safety by requiring party bus licensees to provide each passenger with a summary of acts prohibited on buses| which include unlawful possession of a firearm or controlled substance| security guard if alcohol is present or if the vehicle makes multiple stops. Additionally| the new ordinance requires clearly identifiable signage on licensed large charter/sightseeing vehicles to ensure any buses operating without a license are easy to identify and shut down. The City has imposed nearly $80|000 in penalties to operators found in violation of the party bus ordinance. “As we head to the New Year’s Eve holiday| we want to remind consumers that this tool is there to help ensure their safety as they are celebrating|” said Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. “If a party bus is part of your plan for this weekend| make sure you are dealing with a licensed operator before you book a charter bus or limo.” While Chicago’s new rules have set clear standards for party bus operators in Chicago| a gap still remains for those operating outside the city. In fact| of the 28 cease and desist orders issued to noncompliant vehicles| 18 have yet to comply and are located in the suburbs. To build on the progress made under Chicago’s stricter rules| in 2018 the city will seek new state licensing legislation to better address illegal party bus operators traveling into the City from the suburbs. “Our city ordinance has been a net win for public safety in Chicago|” said BACP commissioner Rosa Escareno. “We are going to take the next step through state legislation to ensure no matter where a party bus company locates their fleet| if they do business in Chicago they had better be serious about ensuring the safety of our communities and the safety of their patrons.” The City will seek several regulatory improvements through state legislation including requiring a state online-registration that helps identify which buses have been properly licensed by the State and passed the required safety inspection| and requiring better State vehicle identification that can be used by City officials.,December 27| 2017

This is the fifth consecutive year that the popular program has met its annual goal. On average| MeterSave customers are saving 30 percent on their water bills for a single family home and 43 percent for a two-flat. "Chicago is fortunate to have a natural resource like Lake Michigan as our front-yard|" said Mayor Emanuel. "At a time when the federal government has forgotten the importance of these types of natural resources| programs like the City's MeterSave continue working to save taxpayer dollars while protecting the region's supply of freshwater." Every day| approximately 5.4 million customers| or 42 percent of the Illinois population| depends on DWM for their water making system efficiency and conservation a priority. Chicago’s MeterSave program| which installs residential water meters free of charge| is designed to promote water conservation. Any resident current on their water bills who owns a single family home or two-flat qualifies for the program. More than 117|000 new meters have been installed since the program began in 2009.  “This program has been so successful because people are seeing considerable savings|” said Randy Conner| DWM Commissioner. “With completely free installation and a seven-year guarantee that bills will be no higher than they would be without a meter| there is no downside to participating.” Non-metered customers pay a flat fee for water every six months. Metered customers pay only for the water they actually use. This amount tends to be well below the estimate calculated by the non-metered payment formula. The program also offers indoor or outdoor water conservation kits as incentives for signing up. For more information| Chicago residents can call 3-1-1 or visit www.metersave.org.,November 2| 2017

88,Mayor Emanuel Expands Local Fight Against Opioid Epidemic,Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) today announced increased efforts to expand Chicago’s fight against the opioid epidemic facing cities and towns across the nation. As part of the Mayor’s 2018 budget proposal| the City will invest an additional $500|000 for a total investment of$2.95 million to prevent and treat substance use disorders. The proposed $500|000 will support an additional 500 individuals in 2018| through Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) and recovery homes| evidence-based practices helping Chicago residents working to overcome addictions to opioids.  “Overdose deaths from heroin and other opioids are skyrocketing across the country| but Chicago is answering the challenge by investing in our communities and working together to find new solutions|” said Mayor Emanuel. “Chicago is investing in treatment and recovery services because we know people can overcome addiction with the proper supports.” As part of the City’s ongoing efforts| CDPH is expanding outreach and education. This week CDPH launched www.overcomeopioids.com| a new online resource hub providing information about services and providers for residents| their family members| and community advocates. Later this year| CDPH will also issue a new Request for Proposal (RFP) to support community health workers to provide education on overdose prevention| naloxone administration| and treatment options.  CDPH also released its latest Epidemiology Report analyzing overdose deaths involving opioids in Chicago from 2015 to 2016. According to the report released by CDPH| there were 741 fatal opioid-related overdoses in Chicago in 2016| an increase of 74 percent from 2015. Following trends seen in other cities| the majority of the increase in opioid-related overdose deaths can be attributed to increases in fentanyl-related overdoses| an opioid that is 50-100 times stronger than heroin. In Chicago| more than 90 percent of overdose deaths were from heroin use or illicit fentanyl. The increased investment provides critical resources at a time when the opioid crisis is worsening both around the country and in Chicago. The new report also shows that every ethnic group| every adult age group and every neighborhood has been impacted. Of all Chicago residents who died of opioid-related overdose in 2016| African American residents account for 48 percent| White residents 34 percent and Latino residents 17 percent. Residents between the ages of 45 and 64 account for nearly half of all opioid-related deaths. Residents of 73 of Chicago’s 77 neighborhoods died of an opioid overdose. “Addiction impacts every one of us| and it is our shared responsibility to provide the resources| information and evidence-based treatment necessary to help overcome opioids|” said CDPH Commissioner Julie Morita| M.D. “By investing in expanded medication assisted treatment| community health workers and education| we are better equipped to face these ongoing challenges.” These efforts to combat opioid addiction follow recommendations made in October 2016 by the Chicago and Cook County Task Force on Heroin| which Mayor Emanuel took a lead role in convening. Under the Mayor’s leadership| the City has undertaken numerous efforts to fight opioid addiction. In 2014| the City sued five big drug companies for deceptive marketing of prescription opioids and for misleading experts and patients about the risks of OxyContin and other opioids| helping to fuel the opioid epidemic. In 2016| Mayor Emanuel reached a major agreement with Pfizer to ensure strict standards in its marketing and promotion of opioids. As part of this work| the City is developing a community and provider education effort privately funded at $375|000 by Pfizer| CVS| Walgreens and Filler Foundation. In addition| the Chicago Police Department is conducting a pilot program that diverts low-level drug offenders to treatment in lieu of an arrest and criminal record. In July 2017| the City of Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection and CDPH announced the new Regulated Business License for Pharmaceutical Representatives to support the City’s efforts to stop deceptive marketing and curb addiction to opioids and other prescription drugs. Any person who markets or promotes pharmaceuticals in Chicago is required to obtain a license| complete mandatory ethics training| receive continuing education and be subject to potential disclosure of their interactions with health care professionals| including gifts. The license has up freed up $700|000 a year and allows CDPH to provide opioid addiction support to an additional 1|000 Chicago residents who live primarily on the south and west sides.

108,Mayor Emanuel and Governor Rauner Announce Sites Proposed in Joint Bid for Amazon HQ2,Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Governor Bruce Rauner today released the sites included in the Chicago area’s bid for Amazon’s HQ2. The bid was submitted earlier this week| concluding a month-long process that brought together an unprecedented group of stakeholders to develop and support a bid that makes clear Chicago is the ideal place for Amazon to invest billions of dollars and create an estimated 50|000 jobs. “The sites identified in Chicago’s bid for HQ2 demonstrate the region’s unparalleled potential to support Amazon’s future growth|” Mayor Emanuel said. “The combination of these prime locations with the country’s most educated population| diversified economy and connected transportation system make it clear that Chicago is the ideal city for Amazon’s second headquarters as the company continues to expand.” “Our state possesses unmatched business| education| technology| logistics| distribution| and academic research assets|” said Governor Bruce Rauner. “These are the core attributes of a community in which Amazon can thrive. More important| they represent a foundation for talent rich| innovative growth for generations to come.” The bid demonstrates Chicago’s depth of site opportunities that each give Amazon the tools and ability to build a future where it can continue to thrive and reach new heights for generations to come. Each site aligns closely with Amazon’s criteria and offers the common strengths of Chicago’s diverse and talented workforce| unparalleled transportation systems and ability to quickly reach any destination in the world. Yet each site also offers a unique set of features that will allow Amazon to tailor a space to meet its needs today| and the needs of the company it will become.  The proposed sites would allow Amazon to be at the very center of a vibrant downtown core| or in an innovative urban district in one of Chicago’s neighborhoods| or in a campus-like environment in our suburbs. City Core  Chicago’s city core| anchored by the "Loop" hub of the CTA’s elevated train system| is the city's central business district and serves as the center of the region’s transportation and communications systems while supporting continued growth all around it.  The Downtown Gateway District is a collection of existing move-in ready buildings| major renovation and new development opportunities at a major gateway to Chicago's business district. This district includes significant space in the Willis Tower| the landmark art deco Old Post Office and new innovative over-site development at Union Station. 18 million sq. ft. of office is available over five existing buildings and seven development sites. A major development site at Union Station| and three new A+ office towers| are the centerpiece.  City Center Campus offers Amazon a unique opportunity to become an integral part of Chicago's Loop. Located in the center of the City| the future campus core is fully integrated into existing infrastructure and a multimodal transportation network with direct access to all downtown CTA rail and bus lines (including Blue Line access to O’Hare International Airport and Orange Line access to Midway International Airport on-site)| designated bikes lanes| pedestrian paths| and a pedway (an underground walkway system). Commuter rail lines with connections to the surrounding suburban destinations (Union| Ogilvie and Millennium Stations) are less than one-half mile away. Innovative Urban Districts  Chicago is seeing major growth north| west and south of the Central Business District (CBD)| including former industrial districts that have become new and diverse communities. These large-scale sites in the immediate vicinity of the CBD would allow Amazon to define an entire new district. Most have a public waterfront presence along either the Chicago River or Lake Michigan and active owners with investment strategies and design options that can be tailored to meet Amazon’s needs. Lincoln Yards is comprised of over 70 riverfront acres between Bucktown and Lincoln Park| two of Chicago’s most iconic neighborhoods. It is a site of scale that offers robust| existing and multimodal transit connectivity| fiber rich infrastructure| a reasonable cost of living| vibrant neighborhood adjacency and immediate development opportunities with future expansion options.  The River District is a new neighborhood in Chicago’s city center| anchored by 37 acres of continuous riverfront land. Located at the confluence of Chicago’s most dynamic office| residential and entertainment districts| The River District is proximate to five separate CTA train stations| the Union Station/Ogilvie downtown commuter train hubs| the interstate highway system| and a dense network of major bus and bike routes. Given its unique locational attributes| the site represents an opportunity to create a new neighborhood that is pedestrian| bike| and transit friendly| while also convenient to regional commuters and international travelers. Fulton Market sits in a 21st Century extension of Chicago’s Central Business District. Once a meat-packing district| it is now a rich mix of office| workspace| restaurants| night-life| hotels and housing intermingled with industry| makers and artists.

111,Mayor Emanuel Announces Five New Early Childhood Education Programming Sites,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced that $1.8 million will be allocated in this year’s budget for five new| high-quality early education programming sites next year. These sites will be designed to meet community need| with input and insights from stakeholders from the communities.  The city’s total early education allocation for the 2018 budget is $15.075 million| which remains consistent with 2017.“Every student deserves a high-quality education that gives them the opportunity to succeed| regardless of their zip code| and that begins with early learning programs|” said Mayor Emanuel. “From early learning through post-secondary| we are making smart| critical investments that support our children’s futures.”The five sites will be selected through a coordinated effort with Aldermen and city agencies to ensure that funding is strategically allocated across the city in a way that best serves the most children. The process for designing these programs involves comprehensive community engagement and a streamlined review by both the Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS) and Chicago Public Schools (CPS) to ensure that all programs being supported by city funding are high-quality and prepare students for kindergarten and continued learning. This year| over 18|000 children across the city will have access to a full-day of preschool—an increase of 80 percent since 2011. The additional five sites will accommodate more than 600 additional children across the selected communities. To improve accessibility| the City of Chicago launched a universal preschool application that serves as a one-stop-shop to help parents find programs| assess program quality| and understand their child’s eligibility for their desired site. This online site provides a single point of entry to access a comprehensive menu of over 600 programs for three- and four-year olds available under Chicago CPS| DFSS and city-administered community-based sites citywide. All locations can be found on the City’s easy-to-use| interactive online portal at http://www.chicagoearlylearning.org.

Moreover| DSS has repaired and refurbished over 10|000 black refuse carts and over 3|000 blue recycling carts in 2016 and to-date in 2017| saving over $660|000 in cart costs.  "With Mayor Emanuel's support| we will continue our zealous fight against rodents| ensuring that every report is addressed within 5 days or less|" said Streets and Sanitation Commissioner Charles L. Williams. "The rodent battle will only benefit from the investment in garbage carts which helps ensure that residents can swap out any damaged carts for a new or refurbished one in a timely manner." Education remains a top priority in rodent abatement. New informational posters are now placed at every baiting location to help residents understand how to eliminate food sources for rodents.  For more information on rodent control services| call 311 or visit www.cityofchicago.org.,October 13| 2017
123,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on President Trump's Actions on Health Care Coverage,“After Americans rejected Trumpcare| the President is single handedly choosing to increase the cost of quality care for the American people. At the same time| he’s making it more complicated for people to enroll in marketplace insurance. The president's actions are harmful and heartless. Americans living in poverty and those working to make ends meet should not suffer because the president is unwilling or unable to improve our health care system. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act| more Chicagoans have quality insurance than ever before. We will work with our partners to make sure all Chicagoans have access| information and assistance for marketplace enrollment this year| even as the President has slashed funding and enrollment time. Open enrollment is from November 1 – December 15.”,October 13| 2017

Today’s approval of a federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) grant by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) will allow CDOT to accelerate work in collaboration with the CTA to launch the design process for a new station.  “The CTA hub at State and Lake is an iconic location in the heart of Chicago and it deserves a state-of-the-art station|” Mayor Emanuel said. “This project has been talked about for more than a decade| and now we are moving forward on plans to rebuild this station and ensure a modern and reliable transit system for Chicago’s residents.” The new State/Lake station will be a modern| fully accessible station with wider platforms| built to 21st Century design standards| consistent with the new Washington/Wabash station. The newly announced federal funding is in addition to existing design funding of $5.5 million. It will not cover the full cost of construction| however| and the City plans to seek additional federal funding for construction. “We are pleased to move closer to providing our customers with yet another new| modern station that is fully accessible and is an important part of our goal of enhancing public transit in Chicago|” CTA President Dorval R. Carter| Jr. said. “We thank CMAP for their support of this project| and look forward to working with our partners at CDOT on this transformational project.” “CDOT greatly appreciates today’s decision by CMAP to prioritize this critically important project|” CDOT Commissioner Rebekah Scheinfeld said. “This allocation of funding allows us to step up the design process. As one of the City’s busiest transfer points| State/Lake is critically important for CTA capacity| safety and the economy of the Central Business District. This project will benefit riders coming from all corners of the city.” The current State/Lake station was originally built in 1895| and last year was the second-busiest station on the Loop ‘L’| with more than 3.1 million annual entries. State/Lake is a second CTA elevated project that CDOT is currently working on for the CTA| in addition to the Damen/Green station that is in design phase. The work on the new stations comes on the heels of the opening of three new stations under Mayor Emanuel: the new Washington/Wabash station in August; a new station at Morgan to serve the Green and Pink Lines in 2012 and the new Cermak-McCormick Place Green Line station in 2015. The full cost of the new station will not be determined until the design process progresses| but it is expected that it will exceed the construction cost of the new station at Washington/Wabash of $75 million.  CDOT| which will manage the project for the CTA| expects to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) before the end of the year for design services for Phases 1 and 2 of the new station| moving the City towards setting a timetable for construction.,October 12| 2017

A pre-submittal conference and networking event will be held at the Garfield Park Conservatory at 10 A.M. on October 25th."I enthusiastically support this project| which will be a definite win-win for the city's diverse west side communities|” Alderman Emma Mitts (37th) said. “It will provide a strong economic investment| creating jobs and expanding resources in the 37th Ward| while increasing public safety for residents in every part of Chicago. I look forward to getting started and breaking ground.”The move is the latest by the Emanuel administration to improve local neighborhoods through innovative partnerships. In February| the Mayor announced 2FM headquarters would move from West Town to Englewood (69th and Wentworth Ave.)| along with 200 jobs. The new facility will be funded in part by proceeds from the sale of the site on N. Throop Street. Additionally| a new branch library on the Near West Side and a new fire station on the Near North Side are being planned through public-private partnerships with local developers. Last week the Mayor announced the City Colleges of Chicago is accepting bids for its downtown headquarters building in preparation for a move closer to its students in the neighborhoods.The estimated cost for the proposed Public Safety Training Academy| including land acquisition| is $95 million. A portion of the Project funding will be from the sale of city-owned land at 1685 N. Throop St. Following a competitive bidding process| the City has reached a tentative agreement to sell the 18-acre site to local developer Sterling Bay for $104.7 million| or $133.53 per square foot. Closing is expected to occur later this year. At least $20 million of the sale of 1685 N. Throop St. will go towards the Public Safety Training Academy| which will support design and construction of the new academy.,October 10| 2017
134,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on President Trump's Immigration Proposal,"President Trump is turning his back on Dreamers and doubling down on dangerous| divisive anti-immigrant policies which would tear families apart| deport law-abiding children to countries they have never known and break America's promise to bright| hard-working young people who are part of the fabric of American society. Chicago will always remain a Welcoming City| stand up for our values and stand by Dreamers who are our classmates| coworkers| friends and neighbors. Congress should not bend to pressure from the Trump Administration| they should codify America's commitment to Dreamers without caving to President Trump's destructive demands.",October 9| 2017
135,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on Richard Thaler,"Congratulations to University of Chicago's Richard Thaler for being honored with the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences.

137,Mayor Rahm Emanuel Announces Chicago Energy Rating System for Large Buildings,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today proposed a Chicago Energy Rating System that makes energy use information for large buildings easily accessible to Chicagoans while encouraging energy savings. Once passed by City Council| the proposed ordinance will use buildings existing and publicly available energy data alongside recent energy improvements to rate buildings on a zero to four star scale. Buildings will be required to post ratings in a prominent location on the property| and share this information at the time of sale or lease listing. Chicago is one of the first US cities to assign buildings an energy performance rating and require properties to post their rating. “By providing simplicity and transparency around building performance| we are giving Chicagoans the tools to better understand energy consumption|” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “This updated ordinance will help drive cost-saving measures for energy efficiency| and will support the development of 21st century jobs for local residents and businesses.” Large buildings are one of the most significant contributors to greenhouse gases in Chicago| comprising 20% of the city’s carbon emissions and spending over $650 million annually in energy costs.  The proposal builds on the City’s existing Energy Benchmarking Ordinance| which requires buildings over 50|000 square feet to measure and report energy use once per year. These buildings currently receive a 1-100 ENERGY STAR score from the US Environmental Protection Agency| based on that building’s energy performance versus like buildings around the country while taking into account occupancy| operational characteristics and Chicago’s climate zone. Buildings that have complied for two or three consecutive years to date have saved an estimated $17.8 million in energy costs per year and have reduced weather normalized energy use by up to 4 percent. The Rating applies to the 3|500 properties already required to annually benchmark energy data| and imposes no additional cost. It will use the building’s most recent score and recent energy improvements to calculate the star rating.  Buildings with one to three stars can earn an additional star by improving their ENERGY STAR score by 10 points or more.  If all buildings with ENERGY STAR scores below 90 were to improve their scores by only 10 points to earn one additional star in the new Rating| buildings would see savings of over $70 million per year.  In addition the investments needed to achieve these savings would generate over 1|000 clean energy jobs. “The work we do with Chicagoans everyday on smarter energy use helps to create jobs and reduce our environmental footprint|” said Anne Evens| CEO of Elevate Energy. “The Mayor's Chicago Energy Rating System increases transparency to building owners and tenants of their energy use which will help spur investments in our city's buildings.” While reporting will continue to be mandated| buildings will not be required to make changes to improve energy efficiency. Buildings that do not comply with the energy benchmarking ordinance will receive zero out of four stars. In addition to posting the star rating publicly on site and providing it at the time of sale or lease| the City will post ratings on the Chicago Data Portal. More information on the current benchmarking ordinance and the Mayor’s Energy Rating System can be found at www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking.  "As Chicago expands its energy efficiency benchmarking ordinance| the city is demonstrating global leadership towards fighting climate change|” said Jen Walling| Executive Director| Illinois Environmental Council. “Energy efficiency is an inexpensive| consumer friendly way to reduce carbon emissions from buildings.  The expanded ordinance will give building owners and tenants more information and greater ability to lower bills and reduce environmental impacts." The Chicago Energy Rating Systems builds upon Chicago’s strategy to reduce harmful carbon pollution. In April| the Mayor announced that by 2025 all of Chicago’s public buildings will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. That transition means that eight percent of the city-wide electricity load or 1.8 billion kilowatt hours will come from clean and renewable sources. This follows the 2013 commitment that the City made to eliminating coal from its electricity supply. Earlier this year| the City of Chicago was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2017 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award. The award is given annually to honor organizations that have made outstanding contributions to protecting the environment through energy efficiency and recognized the four years of successful implementation of the City’s Energy Benchmarking Ordinance. The award also recognized the Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenge and its 79 member buildings covering 53.1 million square feet-all of which have committed to reducing their energy use by 20 percent.  In July| the City of Chicago was ranked number one in the nation for energy efficiency office buildings| according to the 2017 National Green Building Adoption Index published by CBRE Group Inc. and Maastricht University. The city increased its percentage of green office space square footage by 6.5 percent in the last year| growing LEED or Energy Star certified city office buildings to 66 percent. The study ranked 30 of the largest real estate markets in the country and specifically cites Mayor Emanuel’s Benchmarking Ordinance and other aggressive policy measures as catalysts for green building expansion.,October 8| 2017
138,Mayor Emanuel and the Chicago Department of Aviation Break Ground on New Security Checkpoint Project at Midway,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today joined the Chicago Department of Aviation (CDA)| airport partners| elected officials and members of the community for the groundbreaking on a new security checkpoint and bridge expansion project at Midway International Airport. A new 80|000-square foot security pavilion will allow for additional security lanes| enhanced technology and a single checkpoint system that will double Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screening capacity and increase efficiency for passengers. “Today| wait times at Chicago’s airports are among the best in the nation because we have taken steps to improve efficiency| while ensuring more than 100 million passengers can travel safely through Midway and O’Hare each year|” said Mayor Emanuel. “Our investments in security| the first step in Midway's modernization| are more important now than ever before. Over the next three years| we will transform Midway into a truly world class airport at no cost to taxpayers| while creating hundreds of jobs right here in the community.” The kick off of the security checkpoint marks the beginning of construction on the Midway Modernization Program—a $323 million investment announced by Mayor Emanuel in 2015 to deliver the airport’s most significant capital upgrade in nearly two decades. “Each year| more than 22 million people travel through Chicago’s Midway Airport| connecting passengers to destinations around the country—and even a few beyond our borders. This expanded security checkpoint will create jobs| and lead to a safer and more convenient travel experience that will further solidify Midway’s position as a critical transportation hub|” U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) said. “I’m committed to working with the City of Chicago| TSA| and the airlines to ensure Midway has the resources it needs to continue to grow and thrive.” The new security structure and expansion of the pedestrian bridge will provide for a streamlined| single checkpoint area seven times wider than the current security hall and featuring new technology. This development| combined with new TSA automated lanes| is expected to increase the hourly throughput from 2|500 to 5|000 passengers per hour—double the existing capacity. “Chicago’s airports are well-equipped to provide a safe and efficient experience to the traveling public| and to continue offering efficient wait times| thanks to our partnerships with the TSA and airlines|” said CDA Commissioner Ginger S. Evans. “With our passengers’ experience top of mind| security improvements like these continue to be a focal point as we embark on major development projects to ensure our airports are prepared for growing traveler volumes in the years ahead.” By 2019| the addition of new lanes and technology will prepare the airport to meet forecasted passenger demand. With the FAA estimating that air travel in the U.S. is expected to double in the next 20 years| Chicago has already seen its passenger volumes increase. New security technology features installed under this project will improve checkpoint efficiency as the expansion is made| and ensure that as higher volumes of travelers are processed| that the highest levels of security are maintained. “As a senior member of the House Transportation Committee and the Aviation Subcommittee| as well as the representative of Midway Airport| it’s great to join with Mayor Emmanuel and the Department of Aviation to announce this vital improvement for Midway.  Because the airport was rebuilt before 9-11| the security checkpoint sometimes becomes a chokepoint for passengers.  Once this project is complete| Midway Airport will be an even more convenient option for airline passengers|” said U.S. Congressman Dan Lipinski. Over the next two years| the $104 million security checkpoint project will create 470 new construction jobs. In total| the Midway Modernization Program—spanning the redevelopment of Midway’s concessions and terminal garage—will create at least 1|700 jobs and stimulate economic activity throughout the region. "Moving travelers in and out of Midway in the most efficient| expedited| and safe manner must be a fundamental characteristic of an international airport like Midway Airport. In addition| creating over 1|000 new construction jobs is good for the local economy|” said Senator Martin Sandoval| Chairman of the Illinois Senate Transportation Committee. Beyond the expanded capacity for TSA screening functions| the project will contribute to other aspects of the Midway Modernization plan by adding 18|000 square feet for new concession opportunities. Midway’s expanded concessions program will significantly increase dining and shopping options for travelers and generate additional non-airline revenue for the airport. “We applaud Mayor Emanuel for his vision to modernize our largest operation| and we are pleased to invest in this expansion that will enhance the travel experience for our passengers as they move through Midway|" said Craig Vaughn| Director of Stations| Southwest Airlines| Co.. "The Southwest team is always looking to improve the customer experience| and we look forward to the modernization benefitting our tens of thousands of passengers in Chicago each day| as well as those in the community." Security enhancements are underway today at Midway with the installation of new automated screening lanes by the TSA| set to be operational by the end of this month. Midway joins a small number of U.S. airports to feature this innovative technology| which is designed to improve the screening process by automating many of the functions previously conducted manually| and allowing travelers to move more swiftly and efficiently through the checkpoint. “The technology enhancements made by the City of Chicago today mean that Midway will be even better positioned tomorrow to continue providing travelers a safe and smooth travel experience|" Kevin McCarthy| TSA Federal Security Director  for Midway. "Working with our partners at the City of Chicago| we are committed to leveraging the technology and resources that will contribute to an efficient checkpoint experience| but more importantly to ensure the highest level of security for our passengers.” To engage residents in opportunities created by this project| the CDA will continue its ongoing outreach efforts by facilitating a career fair for residents seeking employment in partnership with the project's lead contractor| F.H. Paschen. In addition to CDA’s rigorous community hiring requirements| the contractor has committed to hiring 10 apprenticeship positions| and will conduct its first outreach this fall. Construction of the security checkpoint will be divided into three phases to minimize the impact to the flow of traffic on Cicero Avenue. CDA will work with its partners at the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) to mitigate and inform the surrounding community of traffic impacts as a result of this project as they occur. Rolling| partial lane closures are expected to occur during specific evening hours as soon as next week. The project’s phasing plan also ensures passengers can continue to clear security and get to their gate efficiently while the bridge construction is underway. For updates on traffic| and on progress of the full Midway Modernization Program| the CDA has launched a new website to deliver key information to passengers as well as the general public. The website| www.mdwmod.com| was designed to feature regular updates on construction of the three key Midway Modernization Projects| as well as information that will help travelers plan accordingly and minimize the impact of construction on travel plans. The site will also post information about career fairs and job opportunities for residents.,October 6| 2017

140,Mars Food Opens New North America Headquarters in Chicago,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today joined Mars Food to open the company’s new North America headquarters in Chicago| making it the fourth Mars office on Goose Island. Building on the 125-year history Mars has with Chicago| the Mars Food office brings 75 jobs to the city and signifies a significant investment in this growing business unit within Mars| Incorporated.  “Mars is a great corporate partner| and its international reach and importance are a testament to Chicago’s position at the forefront of the global food industry|” Mayor Emanuel said. “The entire city of Chicago welcomes Mars Food and looks forward to watching them continue to grow and thrive for years to come.” “Moving the Mars Food North America headquarters to Chicago enables our long-term growth objectives by bringing us closer to our factories| our customers and other parts of our business|” said Jarek Swigulski| Regional President of Mars Food North America. “We are excited to join the long-standing relationship and community involvement that Mars has already established in Chicago.” The relocation from Los Angeles to Chicago comes at a time when Mars Food is growing its existing portfolio – which includes the more than 70-year-old| billion-dollar brand UNCLE BEN’S® and the organic food SEEDS OF CHANGE® brand – and working to bring more healthy meals to dinner tables. These ambitious goals are driven by the Mars Food purpose: Better Food Today. A Better World Tomorrow.  The new office space occupies the first floor of a Goose Island-building originally built in 1905. It was designed to reflect the Mars Food commitments to health and wellbeing| sustainability and inspiring people to share meals. These are brought to life via: standing desks at every workstation and available treadmill desks; a living wall that boosts air quality; motion activated lights| desk lamps and LED bulbs that reduce lighting energy by 45% compared to traditional office lighting; and a full kitchen at the center of the office to encourage eating and cooking healthy meals together.,October 5| 2017

144,Mayor Emanuel Announces Applications to Open This Week for Second Round of Neighborhood Opportunity Fund Investments,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced applications for $2.5 million in Neighborhood Opportunity Fund grants will be available on Oct. 4. Launched earlier this year| the initiative generates funding from downtown development projects to support neighborhood commercial corridor growth on Chicago’s south| southwest and west sides.  “This second round of investments will support even more neighborhood entrepreneurs on Chicago’s south| southwest and west sides|” Mayor Emanuel said. “By linking growth downtown directly to growth in our neighborhoods we can create jobs and new community amenities and ensure the entire city of Chicago thrives for generations to come.” The applications will be available at www.neighborhoodopportunityfund.com and are due on Dec. 22| 2017. In June| the Mayor announced the first round of $3.2 million in funding through the program| which is going to 32 businesses across the city| including a vegan restaurant in Chatham| a plant nursery in North Lawndale and an art gallery in West Humboldt Park. The initial recipients were selected from more than 700 applications to the program| created by Mayor Emanuel through reforms to the City’s Zoning Code in the spring of 2016. Approval criteria involve a proposal’s ability to have a measureable| catalytic impact on a community or commercial corridor| based on the availability of similar goods or services and project feasibility| among other factors. Funding for the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund is generated from voluntary payments made by downtown development projects. The payments are in exchange for density bonuses that allow developers to exceed zoning limits for a specific development site. Eighty percent of the payments are applied to the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund for distribution to eligible projects within the West and South sides. The remainder is split in support of infrastructure improvements downtown and improvements to landmark buildings across the city. Eligible costs for Neighborhood Opportunity Fund grants include property acquisition and rehabilitation| small business training| and local hiring subsidies. Up to 65 percent of total project costs are eligible for funding through the program. Grants that exceed $250|000 require City Council approval. Project eligibility is limited to low-to-moderate income areas. The program is administered by the Department of Planning and Development. “This second round of funding through the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund will generate even more critical support for retail and commercial projects in neighborhoods that need them|” Planning Commissioner David Reifman said. “That means more jobs| goods and services that create a foundation for more public and private investment and stability.”,October 2| 2017
145,City Colleges of Chicago Now Accepting Bids for its Downtown Headquarters Building,As City Colleges of Chicago plans to relocate its administrative office| would-be owners of a prime downtown Chicago property have an opportunity to place a bid on its significant headquarters building in Chicago’s West Loop. The community college system announced today that it has officially put the building up for sale and engaged real estate firm CBRE to market it on CCC’s behalf. “The sale of the administrative office building will enable City Colleges to invest more across our campuses| in our communities and will bring the staff closer to its students|” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “This represents another step forward towards ensuring City Colleges students are prepared with the tools and resources necessary to succeed in 21st century careers.”  Among the relocation options CCC is considering is the utilization of space available on its Kennedy-King College campus in Englewood as well as at its Dawson Technical Institute in Bronzeville. City Colleges will also seek an additional small office space for staff to remain in the central business district. The community college system aims to close on the downtown headquarters building with a new buyer by the end of its FY18 fiscal year in late spring. The 185|000-square foot classically-styled office building located at 226 W. Jackson just east of the Willis Tower| represents an outstanding opportunity for redevelopment for office| hotel| residential or retail uses. It sits on 17|400 square feet at the Northeast corner of Jackson and Franklin and is currently zoned by the City of Chicago as “Downtown Core 16.” This flexible zoning allows mixed-use development that will continue the trend of repurposing significant older downtown buildings into modern offices| hotels or residences that has revitalized the Loop in recent years.  “By selling what is an underutilized asset| we will have greater resources to invest in our colleges| in our students| in our communities| all the while achieving a closer relationship between our staff and students|” said Chancellor Juan Salgado. “The recently announced $500 million renovation plans for the Willis Tower along with the redevelopment of the Old Chicago Main Post Office| the growing residential population downtown and the resulting increases in commercial and retail traffic makes this an ideal time to sell our well-located Loop property.”  Earlier this summer| CCC Chancellor Juan Salgado announced the intended sale of the District’s headquarters building in a move intended to right size operations and shift more resources to its colleges located in Chicago neighborhoods. Moving administrative staff to CCC campuses around the city from a building that currently records only 33% occupancy aligns with the Chancellor’s strategy to shift greater focus to the system’s seven colleges and five satellite sites while shoring up the district’s long-term financial health. “The sale of our building is a win-win financially and strategically for the students of City Colleges|” continued Salgado. “Relocating our administrative staff will put them in greater proximity to our students| allowing us to serve them better at a time when our emphasis is on providing students with an exceptional educational and student service experience. The sale of the building will ensure CCC has the financial resources to continue serving the students of Chicago and changing the trajectory of their lives through a quality education.” Conveniently based in the heart of the LaSalle financial district| the building offers great access to the Quincy CTA stop| Union and Ogilvie Stations| and has easy access to major expressways. The daytime business population within a one-mile is over 500|000 and the nearby residential population continues to grow. City Colleges of Chicago has enlisted the services of CBRE| Inc. in facilitating the sale of the property. A brochure offering extensive details about the building at 226 W. Jackson – its amenities and development possibilities – is available| and interested parties may contact Martin Stern| Senior Managing Director of CBRE at 312.456.7070| martin.stern@cbre.com.,October 2| 2017
146,Mayor Emanuel| Congressmen Gutierrez Convene Chicago Leaders to Discuss Relief Efforts to Puerto Rico,Mayor Rahm Emanuel and U.S. Congressman Luis Gutierrez today convened a meeting of Chicago elected officials| community leaders and private stakeholders to discuss relief efforts underway in Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria and plan what next steps are needed to support recovery on the island. "Chicago is home to a proud Puerto Rican community| and since Hurricane Maria struck| Chicagoans on every level have responded not only with our hearts| but with our wallets to help our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico|" said Mayor Emanuel. "We will continue to support the people of Puerto Rico rebuild and recover from this terrible tragedy| and continue to welcome countless families with open arms."  On Wednesday| 23 members of the Chicago Fire Department including firefighters| paramedics| EMTs and engineers will fly to Puerto Rico with defibrillators| stretchers| communications equipment and other supplies. The delegation will spend 10 days on the island and provide an on-the-ground assessment of additional resources needed. The Mayor and the Congressman coordinated with United Airlines to deliver much needed supplies from Chicago to the island| and welcomed evacuees as they arrived at O'Hare last week. The Congressman returned from a visit to Puerto Rico on Sunday and was able to provide a first-hand account of the current conditions and talk about the resources still needed. “Puerto Rican's on the island are working hard under difficult circumstances but are making progress hand in hand with FEMA| private groups and US cities and towns sending aid They need communications| helicopters| engineers and organizational support| which should come from the US military immediately because some people still haven't been contacted| supplied or rescued|" said Congressman Gutierrez. "Right now on the mainland and in Chicago we should be thinking about evacuation and how we give refugees from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands a safe place to recuperate until things improve." On September 25| 2017| United Airlines began humanitarian efforts for residents impacted by Hurricane Maria. The Chicago Department of Aviation led an operation to receive evacuees on these humanitarian flights. A reception area was set up in conjunction with additional city agencies| the Red Cross and The Salvation Army to address immediate needs (i.e.| mental health services| personal items| and hydration items). Once in Chicago| United provided the residents services including a one night hotel stay and connecting travel to alternate destinations. To date| an estimated 1|600 Puerto Rican residents have traveled to Chicago on United and have been provided with assistance and/or connected with family who live in the area.  The Office of Emergency Management and Communications (OEMC) continues coordinating withthe Chicago Fire Department| the Chicago Police Department| the Department of Aviation| Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities| Chicago Department of Public Health| Animal Care and Control| as well as the Red Cross and Salvation Army to help those affected by disasters in Texas| the US Virgin Islands| St. Maarten| Mexico and Puerto Rico. The Fire Department will transport the following supplies to Puerto Rico on Wednesday:,October 2| 2017
147,Mayor Emanuel and Alderman Burke Announce City of Chicago Has Filed Lawsuit Against Equifax Over Recent Data Breach,Mayor Rahm Emanuel| Chairman Edward M. Burke| and Chicago Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel today announced that the City of Chicago has filed a lawsuit against Equifax to ensure that the company is held accountable for its recent data breach and its failure to give timely notice to Chicago residents| as well as to force the company to offer remedies and restitution to those impacted by the breach.  “Chicago residents have been unnecessarily exposed to financial risks due to Equifax’s irresponsible and reckless actions that prioritized profit over the privacy and safety of consumer data|” said Mayor Emanuel.  “We are taking action to hold this company accountable and to protect the residents of Chicago.” From at least March 7| 2017 through July 30| 2017| Equifax left at least 143 million – with more than 5 million in Illinois – consumers’ sensitive and private information exposed and vulnerable to intruders by relying on certain open-source code  that Equifax knew or should have known was insecure and subject to exploitation.  Although patches| workarounds| and other fixes for the related vulnerability were available and known to Equifax| it failed to avail itself of these remedies| or to employ other security controls| such as encryption of data or multiple layers of security| that would help to protect consumers’ personal data. As a result| hackers were able to access Equifax’s computer system from at least May 13| 2017 through July 30| 2017| and according to Equifax’s own estimates| reportedly stole sensitive and personal information of 143 million consumers.  This data breach| which Equifax first disclosed to the public on September 7| 2017| exposed to still-unknown persons the most sensitive personal and financial data of Chicago residents| including full names| social security numbers| dates of birth| addresses| and for some consumers| credit card numbers| driver’s license numbers| and/or other personally-identifiable information. “I commend Mayor Emanuel and Corporation Counsel Siskel for filing suit against Equifax|” said Chairman Burke. “This is a breach of epic proportions and Equifax should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Chicago citizens rely on City government to protect them.” Chicago’s lawsuit claims that Equifax violated the Illinois Personal Information Privacy Act| the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act and the Chicago Consumer Fraud ordinance by exposing this information| failing to provide prompt notice of the breach and misleading concerned consumers by initially falsely representing that it was offering “complimentary identity theft protection and credit file monitoring” while requiring a waiver from future legal action.  “The evidence in this case clearly points to violations of state law and the city’s consumer protection ordinance| and we have an obligation to any resident who has been impacted to seek remedies and fines as a penalty|” said Corporation Counsel Siskel.   Chicago’s lawsuit seeks civil penalties| restitution| and other available relief to address| remedy and prevent harm to Chicago residents resulting from Equifax’s actions and inactions. The penalty for violating Chicago’s ordinance is a fine of not less than $2|000 nor more than $10|000 for each offense| and each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate and distinct offense to which a separate fine shall apply.,September 28| 2017
148,Mayor Emanuel Unveils Renovated Lobby at Chicago Post Office,Mayor Rahm Emanuel| Ald. Daniel Solis and 601W Companies today announced lobby renovations at Chicago’s old Main Post Office are complete and a 100|000-square-foot showroom will soon demonstrate the 2.8-million-square-foot building’s potential as one of the county’s largest commercial structures. “Today| the historic Post Office takes a major step towards its future and a brighter future for the city of Chicago|” Mayor Emanuel said. “After sitting empty and unused for decades| this iconic building is being renovated and revitalized as an economic engine that impacts neighborhoods across the city.” Three hundred and fifty feet long and 38 feet high| the Art Deco-style lobby served thousands of daily post office patrons during the building’s heyday in the 1900s as the nexus of the U.S. mail system. The work included extensive restoration of the lobby’s white-marble walls| stone floors| gold glass mosaic tiles| monumental windows and light fixtures.   The work is part of a more than $600 million rehabilitation project by 601W that will comprehensively repair and update the remainder of the complex| including all interiors and exterior spaces| building systems| windows| elevators| and common areas. The work will also include repairs and improvements to existing rights-of-way for the Eisenhower Expressway and Amtrak railroad trains in the lower levels of the building. An estimated 15|000 people could work in the building when it is fully leased. The rehabilitation project is projected to generate more than 1|500 construction jobs. The agreement also includes requirements for minority- and women-owned business participation in the work to redevelop the facility. “The Post Office will once again revolutionize the Chicago business landscape and be a hub for the future of commerce|” said Brian Whiting| President of The Telos Group| which oversees strategic positioning and leasing of the office space. “We fully recognize the historical significance of this building and intend to preserve its legacy and grandeur and elevate it into a modern era.” The Post Office| at 433 W. Van Buren St.| was designed by Graham| Anderson| Probst & White and built in phases from 1921 to 1932.

159,Mayor Emanuel Launches Historic Streetlight Modernization Program,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today launched the historic modernization of Chicago’s streetlight system by flipping the switch to activate the first four-block stretch to receive the new lights on South Chicago Avenue from 79th to 83rd Streets. The ambitious Chicago Smart Lighting Program will replace 270|000 of Chicago’s public lights with high-quality LED fixtures over the next four years and add a management system that will give the city a state-of-the-art smart lighting grid.   “The Chicago Smart Lighting Program will deliver modern| reliable| energy-efficient lighting that will improve quality of life in every neighborhood and address one of the top reasons people call 311|" Mayor Emanuel said. "This program is a great example of how we are building a new Chicago for the 21st Century." In 2017| streetlight fixture replacement will be focused in neighborhoods with heightened public safety concerns on the west and south sides. This allows communities in the greatest need to most quickly reap the benefits of clearer and more reliable lighting. In addition| during the first twelve months of work| new lights will be installed along key arterial streets in every ward of Chicago| to ensure neighborhoods throughout the City benefit from the improved lighting. The project will also include targeted repairs to poles and wiring to extend the life of existing infrastructure.Also today| the Mayor unveiled the program website: http://chicagosmartlighting.org where Chicagoans will be able to track the progress of the program as new high quality LED streetlights are installed across the City over the next four years.  The new lights| which will be owned and operated by the City| will consume 50-75 percent less electricity than existing high pressure sodium (HPS) lights| generating significant electricity cost savings that will offset the cost of the modernization. LED fixtures also last two-to-three times longer than HPS lights. In addition| ComEd has committed to providing $6.2 million in rebate funding for the program in 2017 as part of the company’s energy efficiency incentive efforts. “CDOT is very excited to launch this massive retrofit project|” CDOT Commissioner Rebekah Scheinfeld said. “The longer life of LED lights will greatly improve the reliability of our lighting and the new smart lighting management system will increase efficiency of city forces by allowing us to respond proactively when outages occur and to restore service more quickly when needed.” The program was procured by the Chicago Infrastructure Trust in close coordination with the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Department of Innovation and Technology. This is the largest project to date from a rebooted CIT| which is dedicated to assisting the City with executing large-scale and complex public projects.  “This project represents a significant investment in Chicago’s future and specifically our neighborhoods|” Chicago Treasurer and CIT Chair Kurt Summers said. “By modernizing our infrastructure| the city will save money over the long term through lower energy costs and vastly improve the lighting on our streets and alleys. This project shows the strength of the CIT and we look forward to continuing other new initiatives that will invest in Chicago in the years to come.” “Residents of the 8th Ward will be very happy to see these modern new LED streetlights installed on our main thoroughfares|” Alderman Michelle Harris said. “These lights will improve nighttime visibility in Chicago’s neighborhoods.”    The project is expected to be completed in four years and cost up to $160 million. The City of Chicago has contracted with a team led by Ameresco Inc.| a national leader in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects| to implement the program.The program includes three components:,September 19| 2017
160,Mayor Emanuel and City Colleges of Chicago Announce Five New Star Scholarship Transfer Partners,City Colleges of Chicago’s (CCC) Star Scholarship program announced five new college and university Star Transfer partnerships today| bringing the total number to 20 of four-year schools giving Star Scholars who graduate from City Colleges additional scholarships towards completion of their bachelor’s degrees.  Saint Xavier University| Kendall College| Marquette University| Southern Illinois University Carbondale and Illinois State University join 15 existing four-year college Star transfer partners whose awards to Star Scholars range from $1|000 up to $50|000/year.  “In the City of Chicago| high school graduation is no longer the last stop on a student’s educational journey and the Star Scholarship removes the burden of cost to receiving a degree|” said Mayor Emanuel. “I am proud of our twenty colleges and universities partners who have taken this a step further and now provide Star Scholars with the opportunity to pursue a high-quality| affordable four-year degree at a school of their choice.”   More than $1 million in additional scholarship funds have been offered to Star Scholars through these transfer partnerships to date. Loyola University has offered the most in scholarships to date ($425|000); University of Illinois at Chicago has accepted the most Star Scholars to date (122); and CME Group| the Star program’s first corporate partner has provided students with 25 $5|000 scholarships and connected 5 CCC students with paid summer internships at elite trading firms. “We have colleges and universities— some of the best in the world— competing for our transfer students|” said City Colleges of Chicago Chancellor Juan Salgado.  “These colleges and universities recognize the value our students bring to their institutions| the contributions they make in and out of the classroom| and the imprint they will make on our economy and world.”In addition to the five new partners| City Colleges has been working with the following universities and colleges to offer Star Scholars additional support once they move on to earn their bachelor’s degree: University of Illinois at Chicago| Columbia College| DePaul University| Dominican University| Governors State University| Illinois Tech| Loyola University| National Louis University| North Park University| Northeastern Illinois University| Northwestern University| Robert Morris University| Roosevelt University| School of the Art Institute of Chicago| and University of Chicago. The combination of these benefits means that a student could obtain a bachelors degree for the cost of 2 or 3 semesters.  For example| a student that earns a semester of credit while in high school (from AP| IB or Dual credit/dual enrollment in City College Courses)| earns a Star scholarship| and then takes advantage of the Star Partnership at the Illinois Institute of Technology could obtain a degree for roughly $40|000 in tuition and fees (using current rates)| compared to $160|000 for your typical in-state student.Since launching its first class in Fall 2015| the Star Scholarship program has seen strong outcomes.  More than 2|900 Star Scholars are enrolled at City Colleges this fall.  67% of the first 890 students in the Fall 2015 cohort have either graduated or are expected to complete by the time their scholarship ends| and this total expected three-year graduation rate for Star Scholars would be nearly triple the national community college graduation rate average.  Furthermore| the percentage of Star Scholars that graduated from CCC in two years was nearly the average national community college graduation rate (22%) after three years. The first year to second year retention rate of Star Scholars (85%) is also nearly double the national average for community college students. Students eligible for the Star Scholarship have graduated from a Chicago Public Schools (CPS) high school with a 3.0 GPA and test nearly college-ready in math and English| and enroll in a City Colleges structured| relevant pathway. The new partnership agreements include:,September 19| 2017
161,Mayor Emanuel Announces Collaborative "Getting to Zero" Initiative that Seeks to Effectively Eliminate New HIV Infections by 2027,CHICAGO – Today| Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced his support for a new collaborative effort to finally eliminate new diagnoses of HIV in Chicago and throughout the state in just ten years. The new “Getting To Zero” (GTZ) initiative includes two key tenets: first| increasing the use of prevention medications among those most vulnerable to the disease; second| ensuring that 70% of all people living with HIV receive the necessary medication to reduce their viral load| which significantly reduces the risk of transmission. GTZ is a collective effort of the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH)| the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and 10 community organizations and hospitals.  “We are more equipped than ever to fight HIV|” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel.  “With the aid of strong community health care partnerships| new treatments and the increased availability of medication to vulnerable populations we have a real chance at stopping the spread of HIV once and for all.” GTZ is a statewide effort of CDPH| IDPH| AIDS Foundation of Chicago| Alexian Brothers Housing and Health Alliance| Center on Halsted| Chicago Black Gay Men’s Caucus| Howard Brown Health| Illinois Public Health Association| Lake County Health Department| Northwestern University| Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center and University of Chicago. The plan was developed following models from Washington State| San Francisco and other jurisdictions to use existing resources and building on effective programs that provide the greatest potential for reducing HIV transmission. Scientific modeling suggests that by increasing the utilization of PrEP| the daily pill that reduces the risk of becoming infected with HIV by more than 90 percent| from 20 percent to 40 percent| and also increasing adherence to antiretroviral treatment among those living with HIV from 50 percent to 70 percent| HIV in Chicago will reach a point where it can no longer sustain itself| or “functional zero.”  Chicago has made significant progress over the years reducing the spread of HIV. There have been fewer than 1|000 new HIV cases annually since 2013| down from a high of 1|850 new cases in 2002. In Chicago| 48 percent of people living with HIV are virally suppressed| meaning they are less likely to transmit the virus. Even though this number is on par with the national average of 49 percent| there is still room for improvement to ensure more people living with HIV are healthy and are less likely to transmit the virus. ,September 19| 2017

MacArthur Foundation have agreed to serve as initial supporters of the Summit.Mayor Emanuel also announced today that Chicago has reduced its carbon emissions by eleven percent from 2005 to 2015| bringing the city to forty percent of the way to meeting its Paris Climate Agreement goals.  The Mayor's June 7 Executive Order established the goal of reducing citywide greenhouse gas emissions to levels equivalent to or greater 26-28 percent reduction from 2005 levels to 2025| the original commitment made by the Obama Administration as part of the United States’ commitment to the Paris Accord.  The reduction in greenhouse gases over the past decade came while the number of jobs within the city increased by seven percent and is equivalent to shutting down a coal power plant for fourteen months.Today’s announcements build on Mayor Emanuel’s strong environmental track record since 2011. Mayor Emanuel has worked with cities around the country to post research from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Change Website after the Trump administration unceremoniously removed it from the federal government’s websites on April 29.  The research can be found on the City of Chicago’s “Climate Change is Real website| www.cityofchicago.org/climatechangeisreal. In April| the Mayor announced that by 2025 all of Chicago’s public buildings will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. That transition means that eight percent of the city-wide electricity load or 1.8 billion kilowatt hours will come from clean and renewable sources. This follows the 2013 commitment that the City made to eliminating coal from its electricity supply. Earlier this year| the City of Chicago was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2017 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award. The award is given annually to honor organizations that have made outstanding contributions to protecting the environment through energy efficiency and recognized the Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenge and its 76 member buildings covering 51.3 million square feet-all of which have committed to reducing their energy use by 20 percent.

164,Mayor Emanuel Announces Chicago Has Met 40 Percent of Paris Climate Agreement Commitments,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced that Chicago reduced its carbon emissions by 11 percent from 2005 to 2015| bringing the city to 40 percent of the way to meeting its Paris Climate Agreement goals.  The Mayor's June 7 Executive Order established the goal of reducing citywide greenhouse gas emissions to levels equivalent to or greater 26-28 percent reduction from 2005 levels to 2025| the original commitment made by the Obama Administration as part of the United States’ commitment to the Paris Accord.  The reduction in greenhouse gases over the past decade came while the number of jobs within the city increased by 7 percent and is equivalent to shutting down a coal power plant for 14 months. “While the current administration buries its head in the sand on climate change| it is now up to Chicago and other cities to develop a sustainable 21st century economy|” said Mayor Emanuel. “This report confirms that protecting the environment and growing jobs go hand in hand. This city| alongside numerous other cities across the country| is proud of its commitments to bringing down carbon emissions levels.”This final emissions inventory report analysis| developed by AECOM| found that Chicago generated 32.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2015| compared to 36.9 million in 2005.  The analysis focused on carbon emissions in major sectors| including stationary energy| transportation and waste| with significant reductions driven by a mix of reduced electricity consumption and the use of cleaner forms of energy. The report follows-up on the preliminary analysis from this January| which showed a 7 percent reduction in Chicago's carbon emissions from 2010 to 2015.  The preliminary and final reports can be found at www.CityofChicago.org/Emissions. “The emission reductions work being done in cities is critical to meeting 'America’s Pledge' -- our commitment to fulfilling the Paris Agreement|” said Mike Bloomberg| UN Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change. “Chicago is helping to lead the way| and I applaud Mayor Emanuel for the city's progress."This announcement builds on Mayor Emanuel environmental commitments through Retrofit Chicago| which comprises efficiencies made to buildings| streetlights and benchmarking goals.  Through the Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenge| 76 member buildings covering 51.3 million square feet have committed to reducing their energy use by 20 percent. Additionally| the City’s Energy Benchmarking Ordinance| which was implemented in 2012| has reduced energy use by four percent in buildings covered by the ordinance. Retrofit Chicago is a finalist for the C40 Cities Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards| which will take place in December. Earlier this year| Chicago was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2017 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award.

In March| Mayor Emanuel| the Chicago Department of Transportation and the Chicago Infrastructure Trust announced the Chicago Smart Lighting Project which will replace 85 percent of Chicago’s light fixtures and add a management system that will give the city a state-of-the-art smart lighting grid. These new lights| which will be owned and operated by the City| will consume 50-75 percent less electricity than existing high pressure sodium lights| generating significant electricity cost savings that will be utilized to pay for the modernization.Since the Trump administration’s announcement to pull out of the Paris Agreements| cities across the country and the world have committed to creating a sustainable future for their residents. Mayor Emanuel joined over 300 Mayors from around the country to commit to the Paris Agreement as part of the Mayors National Climate Agenda| or Climate Mayors.  This network of U.S. mayors — representing over 56 million Americans in red states and blue states — work together to strengthen local efforts for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting efforts for binding federal and global-level policy making.  Mayor Emanuel also joined over 1|000 state| local| and business leaders from across the country as part of the “We’re Still In” campaign| coming together to signal the importance of the Paris Accord both nationally and across the world.Mayor Emanuel has worked with cities around the country to post research from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Change Website after the Trump administration unceremoniously removed it from the federal government’s websites on April 29.  The research can be found on the City of Chicago’s “Climate Change is Real website| www.cityofchicago.org/climatechangeisreal. ,September 18| 2017
165,Mayor Emanuel| City of Chicago Announce Legal Victory as Federal Judge Grants Nationwide Preliminary Injunction Against President Trump's New Conditions on Public Safety Grant Funding,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced that a federal judge granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against Attorney General Sessions because of new conditions the Trump Justice Department attempted to impose on the Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant| which provides critical public safety funding. The ruling was made in a federal lawsuit the City filed to prevent President Trump's Justice Department from requiring grantees to comply with unrelated and unlawful grant conditions that would have required Chicago to assist with Federal immigration enforcement. “Progress is never easy| but it is always worth fighting for. In Chicago we will always fight for our values and the rights of our residents|” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “Today’s ruling means essential resources for public safety in Chicago and across the country cannot come with unlawful strings attached from the Trump Justice Department. This is not just a victory for the City of Chicago| but a win for cities| counties and states across America.” In his ruling| U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber agreed with the City that the federal government has no authority to require the City to provide 48 hours advanced notice to the federal government before releasing a suspected undocumented immigrant from custody| and grant unlimited access to City lockups for federal immigration officials to interrogate suspected undocumented immigrants. The City’s legal briefs explained that the conditions are invalid and unconstitutional. The City also explained that the trust between immigrant communities and state and local governments would be irreparably harmed without a preliminary injunction| and that a nationwide injunction is necessary to protect all grant applicants from the invalid and unconstitutional conditions placed on the grant. “We are very pleased that the judge agreed that the Department of Justice does not have the authority to add requirements to a grant program that was created by Congress and has operated for many years under the established conditions|” said Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel. “We took this action to stand up for Chicago’s values and to ensure we did not lose important public safety grants by refusing to cooperate with these new unlawful conditions. This ruling makes clear that the Attorney General does not have the authority to unilaterally impose new requirements without approval from Congress.” Over the years| Chicago has used Byrne grant funds| in a number of ways to benefit public safety| including the purchase of SWAT equipment| police vehicles| radios and tasers. On August 31| the Chicago Police Department (CPD) submitted its application for FY2017 Byrne grant funding| making clear that the City will not agree to unlawful and unrelated new conditions attached to the federal grant application. CPD proposes using this grant funding to expand ShotSpotter gunfire detection| one of the key components of the new| strategically located nerve centers that help police get ahead of crime and prevent violence from happening in the first place.  This grant funding  would allow CPD to add an additional 20.31 square miles to the ShotSpotter network in Districts 003 and 004| two police districts experiencing higher than average rates of gang and gun related crime. “This Police Department is only as strong as the community’s belief in us|” said Acting Superintendent Kevin Navarro. “Every single day| CPD is building that trust through community policing and forging meaningful relationships with residents in every neighborhood. Regardless of who you are or where you are from| you will always have a right to be safe in Chicago.” The City of Chicago is supported in its legal efforts on this issue by two outside law firms| Riley Safer and Wilmer Hale who are providing their services pro bono.,September 15| 2017

As the first woman to hold the position of Majority Leader| she shattered a glass ceiling and blazed a trail for countless others.

Kaplan said. “This collaboration brings together leading academic bodies and key organizations in Chicago| including Current| and I have no doubt that we are laying the foundation for a long-term cooperation that will benefit not only the Technion and Chicago| and even not only Israel and the United States| but all of humanity.” The agreement establishes academic partnerships in areas of fundamental science and applied water research between Technion and Current’s Research Consortium| which is comprised of Northwestern University| the University of Chicago| the University of Illinois (Urban/Champaign)| the University of Illinois (Chicago)| the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago and the Chicago Department of Water Management. The partnership will create a broad collaborative research platform between Current and the Technion| linking water research| technology development| commercialization| and deployment in industry and infrastructure. “This effort brings together world-class scientists to tackle the critical challenge of ensuring that people worldwide have the water they need|” Steve Frenkel| Executive Director of Current said. “Leveraging the global reach of Current’s new research consortium will accelerate the science needed to deliver the water technology innovations society desperately needs.” The agreement is designed to increase research outcomes that result in deployed solutions and aligned water research efforts between the Technion and Current’s Research Consortium.

178,Mayors Emanuel| de Blasio| Garcetti| Kenney & Walsh File Another Legal Brief Against President Trump's Travel Ban,Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel| New York Mayor Bill de Blasio| Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti| Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh today announced the Cities of Chicago| New York City| Los Angeles| Philadelphia| Boston| 39 other cities and counties| the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities have filed another legal brief| this time in the United States Supreme Court| supporting legal challenges to President Donald Trump’s efforts to restrict travel to the United States from six majority-Muslim nations and to suspend the refugee program.“With his harmful| immoral and unlawful actions| President Trump has turned his back on the world and abandoned America’s values|” said Mayor Emanuel.  “Diversity is Chicago’s strength| and we will always welcome individuals and immigrants of every color| culture and creed. I am proud to stand with Mayors and municipalities from across the country in presenting a united legal argument to the Supreme Court to ensure that America’s beacon still burns brightly for all.”Today| Chicago led a total of 44 cities and counties| in addition to the U.S. Conference Mayors and the National League of Cities| in filing a friend-of-the-court (amicus) brief in support of the plaintiffs| the State of Hawaii| an immigrant rights group and several individuals who challenged two provisions of the Executive Order| both the President’s travel ban for individuals from certain Muslim-majority countries and the suspension of the admission of refugees into the United States.  Both the Fourth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals upheld preliminary injunctions against the Order. The U.S. Supreme Court has combined the cases and will hear oral argument in the consolidated case in October. “New York| alongside cities across the country| is again standing strong against the un-American| exclusionary policies of President Trump|” said Mayor de Blasio. “We are proud to embrace immigrant communities that are an essential part of our cities| where they help strengthen the local economy and contribute to civic life. This policy not only discriminates against immigrant communities| but also makes us all less safe by undermining trust with law enforcement and making immigrants more vulnerable to victimization. By targeting individuals from Muslim-majority nations| this order is also a refutation of our nation’s historic commitment to be a home of refuge for those fleeing violence. New York| in partnership with cities across America| will keep fighting misguided and dangerous policies that are an affront to our morals.”"The President's own statements make clear that this revised policy has little to do with public safety| and everything to do with his divisive political strategy| unlawfully aimed at one religious group|" said Mayor Kenney. "I am proud to join my fellow Mayors and other cities across the country in standing up for immigrants and their families|" said Mayor Walsh. "Together we are sending a clear message that preventing people from entering the country based solely on their faith runs counter to everything we stand for as Americans. Now is the time for us to reaffirm our values as a nation| and show that we will continue to be a country that will defend our most cherished principles.""The U.S. Conference of Mayors is proud to join with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and other mayors in challenging the President's travel ban|" said Conference of Mayors CEO and Executive Director Tom Cochran. "The Conference has strong policy opposing all forms of discrimination and hate speech based on an individual’s religion and country of origin| welcoming Muslims as U.S. residents| and supporting the U.S. refugee program. The President's Executive Order clearly discriminates against Muslims and refugees. The nation's mayors urge the Supreme Court to strike it down.""America's city leaders stand united against all exclusionary policies based on religion or national origin|" said Clarence E. Anthony| CEO and Executive Director of the National League of Cities. "Such orders undermine public trust in law enforcement and impact both tourism and workforce development. As city leaders| we welcome all those who dream of building new lives in our cities| towns and villages."In addition to the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities| Chicago| New York City| Los Angeles| Philadelphia and Boston| joined by Alexandria| Ann Arbor| Austin| Baltimore| Brighton| Carrboro| Central Falls| Cook County| Dayton| Denver| Durham| Evanston| Gary| Honolulu| Iowa City| Ithaca| Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer| Minneapolis| Madison| Montgomery County (Maryland)| Nashville| New Haven| New Orleans| Normal| Oakland| Portland| Providence| Rochester| Saint Paul| San Francisco| San Jose| Santa Clara County| Santa Monica| Seattle| Skokie| South Bend| Tucson| West Hollywood and West Sacramento| presented the local government position to the U. S. Supreme Court. The brief points out that President Trump claims unbridled and essentially unreviewable authority to exclude – on a blanket basis – hundreds of millions of Muslims from the United States just because they are Muslim.  His intent has been clear since the campaign| where he repeatedly promised to do just what he did in the travel ban.  The blatant discrimination against Muslims is a violation of our constitutional religious freedom and it is repugnant to the values our communities hold dear.The brief explains the vital contribution that immigrants make to our cities and country and argues that the travel ban is misguided and unconstitutional. Further| the brief argues that cities and counties serve as gateways for immigrants and refugees starting new lives in America| and that the President’s executive order endangers communities; undermines national security; limits the labor pool; decreases tax revenues; dampens tourism industries; and harms businesses| educational institutions and hospitals. Earlier this year| President Trump issued an executive order| followed by a revised executive order| restricting immigration by prohibiting people from six countries—Iran| Libya| Somalia| Sudan| Syria and Yemen—from entering the U.S. for 90 days and halting the admission into the United States of people granted refugee status for 120 days.Today’s filing is the fifth brief Chicago| New York| Los Angeles| Philadelphia| Boston and other cities and counties have filed against President Trump’s attempts to restrict travel into the United States. The City’s brief was prepared with the pro bono assistance of several attorneys of the law firm Riley Safer Holmes & Cancila LLP| which has offices in Chicago| New York and San Francisco.  The recent legal action is one of several actions the Emanuel Administration has taken since the November election to reiterate Chicago’s status as a welcoming City.Among these| to provide legal assistance to vulnerable Chicago residents| the city created a Legal Protection Fund| pledging $1.3 million to the fund to integrate legal support from attorneys with community navigators rooted in Chicago's many ethnic communities to provide outreach| education and assistance to immigrant families across Chicago.In August| Mayor Emanuel announced that the City of Chicago filed a federal lawsuit to prevent President Trump’s Justice Department from making a federal crime prevention grant that is critical to public safety efforts conditional on unrelated and unlawful immigration enforcement actions. As part of the suit| the City is asking the court to declare Attorney General Jeff Session’s actions in imposing new conditions to the FY2017 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program unlawful and that Chicago and its Welcoming City ordinance are in compliance with all valid and applicable federal laws. Earlier this week| Mayor Emanuel called on Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner and the Illinois General Assembly to establish an Illinois Dreamers Bill of Rights. The bill would enshrine protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) – also known as Dreamers – guaranteeing them access to state financial aid and scholarships| professional licenses and certifications for jobs and additional protections against deportation.Mayor Emanuel| U.S. Senator Dick Durbin and Congressman Luis Gutierrez also launched a new “Chicago is With You” task force that is collaborating on mental health| legal services| employer communications| and education policies to ensure the City is delivering comprehensive services to immigrants| refugees and other disenfranchised communities.Since taking office| Mayor Emanuel has launched a series of initiatives that improve the immigrant community’s access to services| expand new and existing immigrant businesses| and welcome and celebrate Chicago’s diverse immigrant communities. These initiatives include launching the Cities for Citizenship Campaign with the Mayors of New York City and Los Angeles| which has grown into a bipartisan effort which works with 30 city and county leaders across America.,September 8| 2017

181,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on Trump Administration's Decision to End DACA,"Amy and I have had the pleasure of hosting dreamers in our home for dinner. You can see in their eyes and hear in their voices how much it means to them to be part of the fabric of America. President Trump’s decision to end DACA is not only harmful to these young people| it strikes a blow against our core American values and is an affront to basic human decency. It is a betrayal of more than 800|000 children who have done nothing wrong and of the unique role the United States has played in the world for centuries. The United States is a nation of immigrants| not a country that tears families apart or deports children who have placed their faith in the promise of America. I know countless dreamers in Chicago who are talented| hard-working and dedicated to their families and the only home they have ever known. Not only will Chicago continue to welcome dreamers| we will pursue every legal option to protect our children| defend our immigrant communities and uphold the enduring promise of the American Dream.”,September 5| 2017

183,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on DACA,“By intimidating immigrant communities and threatening to dismantle DACA| President Trump is threatening to violate the promise the United States' government made to these young people. DREAMers came out of the shadows and gave their names| addresses and phone numbers to the U.S. government. The idea that our government would use that information to go after them is unconscionable. Every day| DREAMers defend our nation in the military| attend our universities and contribute to communities across the country. Their patriotism and dreams cannot be measured by where they were born. Whether it is across the Rio Grande| over the Atlantic or up the Mississippi| we will continue embracing all those who chose to call Chicago home| and we will not stop fighting for the values that make this nation great. DREAMers upheld their end of the bargain| and this Administration better uphold America’s promise and ideals. It is time for President Trump to stop trying to tear down President Obama’s unifying agenda and more time trying to build his own.”,September 1| 2017

185,Mayor Emanuel Announces Amicus Briefs Have Been Filed in Support of Chicago's Lawsuit to Prevent President Trump's Justice Department from Making Federal Crime Prevention Grants Conditional on Unrelated Immigration Enforcement Actions,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced that a number of amicus briefs have been filed in support of Chicago’s lawsuit to prevent President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice (DOJ) from making a federal crime prevention grant that is critical to public safety efforts conditional on unrelated and unlawful immigration enforcement actions. The City of Chicago has applied for the FY2017 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program while making clear that the City will not agree to unlawful and unrelated new conditions attached to the federal grant by President Trump’s Justice Department.“We will not allow President Trump’s Justice Department to blackmail us into abandoning our values as a welcoming city| violating the Constitution or undercutting the Police Department’s community policing strategy|” said Mayor Emanuel. “The Trump Administration’s actions are flagrantly unlawful and unconstitutional| which is why a significant number of cities| municipalities| counties| mayors| law enforcement officials| prosecutors and advocacy organizations from across the country are standing with Chicago in this important legal fight.”A number of groups have filed amicus briefs| also known as friend of the court briefs| in support of Chicago’s lawsuit including:  37 cities| counties and municipalities across the country led by Santa Clara County| California and including New York City| Los Angeles and Philadelphia| in addition to the U.S. Conference of Mayors| the National League of Cities| the National Association of Counties| the International Municipal Lawyers Association| and the International City/County Management Association; a group of 23 current and former law enforcement officials and prosecutors from around the United States; Cook County| Illinois; Erie House; the Illinois Business Immigration Coalition; the National Immigrant Justice Center; and the California State Legislature.“The vast array of cities| counties| law enforcement officials and business interests that have filed amicus briefs in support of our lawsuit share more than our legal position| they share our values as a welcoming city and our dedication to community policing|” said Ed Siskel| Chicago Corporation Counsel.  “The Trump Justice Department immediately started to backtrack on these unlawful and unconstitutional conditions in response to our complaint| and we are confident that our legal efforts will prevent the DOJ from forcing us to choose between our values and important public safety funds.”Over the years| Chicago has used Byrne JAG funds in a number of ways to benefit public safety| including the purchase of SWAT equipment| police vehicles| radios and tasers. Yesterday| the Chicago Police Department submitted its application for FY2017 Byrne JAG grant funding| making clear that the City will not agree to unlawful and unrelated new conditions attached to the federal grant application. The Chicago Police Department (CPD) proposes using FY2017 JAG funding to expand ShotSpotter gunfire detection| one of the key components of the new| strategically located nerve centers that help police get ahead of crime and prevent violence from happening in the first place.  The funding in this grant would allow CPD to add an additional 20.31 square miles to the ShotSpotter network in Districts 003 and 004| two police districts experiencing higher than average rates of gang and gun related crime."The funds from the Byrne JAG grant will help us to expand the technology that has helped to significantly reduce gun violence in Chicago this year|" said First Deputy Police Superintendent Kevin Navarro.  "In order to sustain our progress| we need to expand our partnership with the communities we serve| that starts with building trust. Any obstacle to gaining that trust or the funds that will aid in our crime strategy will make it more difficult for Chicago police officers to do their jobs effectively and safely."Police nerve centers serve as dedicated intelligence hubs| where dedicated district leadership| crime analysts from CPD and the University of Chicago| and police officers monitor developments and gang conflicts in real-time| make fluid decisions regarding deployments| and allow CPD to make changes to their strategy as the situation dictates. The centers and its staff utilize historical crime data| input from ShotSpotter| video from pod cameras| and analyze them through HunchLab software to help police be more predictive| more proactive| and focus on the right people| at the right place| at the right time.  For officers in the field| they will be able to access real-time intelligence information and instant notifications from ShotSpotter through mobile phones equipped with the software. This technology allows police to have access to a wide range of information at their fingertips and significantly cut down response times to shooting incidents which can make the difference between life and death and can increase the chances of capturing an offender.On August 7| 2017| the City of Chicago filed a federal lawsuit against President Trump’s Justice Department for attaching unlawful and unconstitutional conditions to the FY2017 JAG application| including provisions to provide unlimited access to local police stations and law enforcement facilities by U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel to interrogate arrestees and the requirement that cities provide DHS with at least a 48 hour notice prior to an arrestee’s release| which would require detaining residents longer than is permissible under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. President Trump’s Justice Department filed its response to the lawsuit on August 24| 2017| in which the Administration announced that it was changing the conditions to avoid the Fourth Amendment problems identified by the City’s lawsuit. Further| the judge made it clear| and the DOJ agreed| that while this litigation is pending| the City would be able to submit the 2017 JAG application without certifying its compliance with these new| unlawful conditions. Yesterday| the City of Chicago filed the reply brief to support its motion for a preliminary injunction. Like the original lawsuit| the reply further establishes the reasons the DOJ’s conditions are invalid and unconstitutional; argues that the Byrne JAG statute contains no authorization for the conditions| and DOJ offers no authority for the conditions in the grant statute; and states that DOJ’s position also contradicts the Byrne JAG statute| which expressly restricts the Attorney General’s authority to limit Byrne JAG grant funds for specific purposes favored by the Attorney General. The reply also states that Chicago would be irreparably harmed without a preliminary injunction| and that a nationwide injunction is necessary to protect all Byrne JAG grant recipients across the country from the invalid and unconstitutional conditions placed on the grant.,September 1| 2017
186,Mayor Emanuel| Alderman Tunney Announce Plan to Change Time of the Cubs' September 8 Game,With the Chicago Cubs locked in a race for the National League Central Division Championship| and with a trip to the postseason on the line| Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Alderman Tom Tunney announced they have reached an agreement to move the team’s game against the Milwaukee Brewers on Friday| September 8 from 1:20 pm to 7:05 pm.

"It also brings us one step closer to creating 100 percent CTA rail station accessibility across the system and putting us even farther ahead of other legacy systems."The new station replaces stations at Madison/Wabash and Randolph/Wabash| both built in 1896. It will also improve travel time around the Loop for passengers and lower maintenance and operational costs for CTA. Additionally| the station was built to be sustainable| reusing existing structure| tracks and other elements and including the installation of bicycle racks to encourage alternative transportation as well as recycling bins on the platforms.The Washington/Wabash station also features a new public artwork created especially for the station by Chicago-based artist Michiko Itatani. Two large art glass panels located on both sides of the mezzanine – Cosmic Wanderlust 1 & 2 – reflect on human history and culture of the past| present and future. The artist’s multi-colored perspective of this theme features images of libraries| museums| public spaces and performance halls intermingled with images of the cosmos.  The $75 million new station was funded through federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program. Now that this station is open| the station just to the north| at Randolph and Wabash will be permanently closed on Sunday| Sept. 3. Demolition and removal will be completed before the end of 2017.The Washington/Wabash station is the latest in Mayor Emanuel and CTA’s $8 billion in transit improvement projects to build a 21st century| world-class transit system.

190,Citywide Mental Health Steering Committee Takes Steps on Police Reform| Mental Health Crisis Response,Mayor Emanuel today announced another step forward in the city's efforts to improve crisis response for individuals with mental illness as part of the city's ongoing police reform efforts that includes strengthening mental health crisis response. Over the last eight months| more than 500 community members in Austin| Garfield Park and North Lawndale have received free mental health awareness training to reduce stigma and provide information on emergency response resources. "Effective training is another a critical part of our continued police reform efforts and ensuring that the city is providing an effective and compassionate mental health emergency response|" said Mayor Emanuel. "Over the past year| the city has advanced mental health training that takes a holistic look at all aspects of the response. By not only training police officers and 911 dispatchers and call takers on effective emergency response| but also training the community on mental health symptoms and resources available| we can reduce stigma and better meet the needs of individuals who may be experiencing a mental health crisis.”The successful pilot trained more than 500 west side residents in awareness and identification of the signs and symptoms of a possible mental health crisis. In addition| residents learned about support services available from the City and community organizations| including the option to request a specially trained Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) trained police officer in the event of a crisis. "We know that individuals who have experienced trauma are more likely to face mental health challenges and engage in risky behaviors|" said Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner| Dr. Julie Morita. "The early results of our efforts of improving crisis response through trauma-informed practices show promise that with evidence-based training and interventions we are better able to identify| serve and ultimately treat those individuals with mental health challenges during a crisis." The pilot project grew out of Mayor Emanuel’s Citywide Mental Health Response Steering Committee| a coordinated effort to address how the city’s first responders can better serve individuals with mental illness. The goal was to free mental health training to 400 community members in partnership with schools| faith-based institutions and community organizations in the west site. “These results show evidence that this approach to addressing stigma and improving crisis response may be an effective way to engage communities in the solution.” said Kelly O’Brien| Executive Director for The Kennedy Forum| which advocates for ending stigma and discrimination against people dealing with mental health and addiction challenges. “We recommend that trainings be expanded to additional communities.” The University in Chicago (UIC) Jane Addams College of Social Work is spearheading an evaluation of the effectiveness of this training and presented an interim report to West Side Outreach Project organizers. UIC researchers confirmed that the preliminary results of the pilot show decreased stigma associated with mental health and addiction| increased knowledge and comfort in contacting a CIT trained police officer| increased knowledge about mental health and increased confidence that they could assist someone in need. Additionally| of the 296 people who participated in the study| a majority| approximately 70 percent| said that either they personally have| or a family member has| experienced mental health challenges. "These results are significant and indicate the community trainings are having an impact|" said Amy Watson| PhD| UIC Jane Addams College of Social Work faculty who led the evaluations. Trainings were offered to faith leaders| school staff and staff and volunteers from community based organizations. UIC led the pre-and-post evaluations of the effectiveness of the trainings| which were provided by Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago: Center for Childhood Resilience| Laynie Foundation| National Alliance for Mentally Ill (NAMI) Chicago| Presence Health| Sinai Health System: Under the Rainbow| Thresholds and Trilogy Behavioral Healthcare. The pilot is funded through the Chicago Department of Public Health.  "There are service calls that an officer may respond to involving individuals who are experiencing some type of mental health crisis|" said Police Deputy Superintendent Kevin Navarro. "Participating in this effort is part of our commitment to changing how we police in Chicago and making sure that individuals suffering from these crises receive treatment in a hospital and not a jail cell."The final report from UIC will be released early 2018 and will include additional findings to determine if the trainings resulted in referrals to community mental health services and increased requests for CIT trained officers in these communities. The Citywide Mental Health Response Steering Committee includes representatives from Mayor’s Office| Chicago Police Department| Office of Emergency Management and Communications (OEMC)| Chicago Fire Department| Chicago Department of Public Health| NAMI Chicago| The Kennedy Forum| Thresholds| Mount Sinai Health System and University of Illinois at Chicago. The Steering Committee continues to meet monthly to address its goals of improving training| increasing access to social services| reducing the stigma of mental health| educating the public on mental health first response| and collecting better data on outcomes.    West Side Outreach Project partners include: Advocate Health Care| Alderman Burnett| Alderman Ervin| Alderman Mitts| Alderman Scott| Alderman Taliaferro| Anixter Center| Ann & Robert H.

208,Mayor Emanuel| Department of Streets and Sanitation Tout Efficiency of Graffiti Removal,CHICAGO – Mayor Rahm Emanuel today joined Department of Streets and Sanitation (DSS) Commissioner Charles L. Williams to check in on the status of the City’s graffiti removal program. This year| Chicago has seen a 17 percent reduction in resident graffiti complaints over last year| which DSS attributes to swift graffiti removals under the grid model and additional resources like new blaster trucks. “Under the more efficient grid model powered by additional resources and crews| DSS has created a more efficient graffiti removal system - in many cases| graffiti is removed before residents even have a chance to report it|" said Mayor Emanuel. “From tree trimming| to snow plowing| to rodent abatement| and much more| Chicago continues to strengthen neighborhood services by getting work done more efficiently and more effectively."DSS uses a grid-based graffiti removal system| which enables crews to complete five wards every day. As compared to last year| DSS has reported 17 percent fewer graffiti removal calls. The Department has completed over 57|000 graffiti removals citywide so far this year and crews continue to respond to requests within five business days or less. Prior to the grid model| crews would respond to calls within 10 days. “The grid system has helped the Department improve its operations in everything from garbage to graffiti.  This system allows crews to quickly remove markings| which serves as a significant deterrent for future vandals|” said Commissioner Williams. "With Mayor Emanuel's constant support| we are able to try new strategies to ensure that we are providing the most competent and cost-effective services possible to our residents.” In May| DSS also announced that eight new chemical trucks had been added to the City’s graffiti removal fleet. The Department also redirected three new crews to help tackle graffiti thanks to efficiencies realized through grid refuse collection.Graffiti removal is a free service offered by the City of Chicago.  The graffiti program works with aldermen| community groups| block clubs| chambers of commerce and residents to respond to reports of graffiti.  Residents who would like to report graffiti can call 311| or visit www.cityofchicago.org/dss.,August 18| 2017
209,Mayor Emanuel Opens Phase II of the Northeast Cargo Development and Announces Record Cargo Activity at O'Hare,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today joined the Chicago Department of Aviation (CDA)| Aeroterm and cargo executives for the opening of the second phase of the $220 million northeast cargo development at O’Hare International Airport. The new cargo facility opens ahead of schedule in direct response to the strong demand for moving air cargo through Chicago to markets around the world. In just under a year| the partial completion of the northeast cargo development has already created approximately 600 permanent jobs| outpacing earlier projections it would create 1|200 jobs when the project is complete. With O’Hare’s newest cargo development on track and ahead of schedule| air cargo volume is already up by 15 percent over last year| putting Chicago on pace to handle 1.8 million tonnes in 2017. This marks another record year for cargo at O’Hare—one of the nation's premier cargo airports. “The City of Chicago is making investments and improvements to ensure O’Hare has not only the best commercial service| but the best cargo space|” said Mayor Emanuel. “With the next step of this project complete| we are delivering on our promise to grow O’Hare’s capacity and competitiveness| and in turn| its ability in the long-term to provide thousands of new jobs and serve as an economic driver for our city.” The Northeast Cargo development expands and enhances the efficiency of the airport’s cargo operations at no cost to Chicago taxpayers| funded by a $160 million investment by Aeroterm and more than $62 million of airport funds. The 240|000-square-foot Phase II building is home to Burak| Cargolux and Swissport tenant operators. When complete| it will be the largest airside cargo development built in the last decade at a U.S. international gateway airport. “O’Hare has long been a leading airport for air cargo| and thanks to Aeroterm’s development| Chicago is processing record cargo volumes|” said Ginger S. Evans| CDA Commissioner. “The opening of both Phases I and II of our northeast cargo development ahead of schedule is a testament to the strong demand and the fact that businesses around the world are continuing to choose Chicago O’Hare as their preferred North American gateway.” Keeping pace with Phases I and II of the northeast cargo development| and to support the record growth of air cargo| Phase III is now expected to open in 2-3 years| also ahead of schedule. In total| these investments will create an estimated 10|000 new construction and permanent jobs| as well as hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue for the City.  “There’s no better time to be investing in Chicago’s cargo operations| which is why Aeroterm is proud to partner with the City of Chicago as the developer of this major infrastructure project|” said Erin Gruver| Chief Development Officer| Aeroterm. “Not only will these investments our state of the art on-airport cargo warehousing support the rapid growth of cargo operations| but they will in turn improve efficiency of O’Hare’s airfield and facilitate healthy economic growth for years to come.” Expanding new cargo warehouse capacity provides O’Hare the ability to process a greater volume of air cargo in a number of ways. The addition of 747-8 capable aircraft ramps provides 50 percent additional capacity to handle cargo from jumbo jet freighters; and in its final form the northeast cargo development will deliver 800|000 square-feet of warehousing and apron pavement. These investments will make way for up to 15 wide body aircraft to unload at any given time at O’Hare. And with each jumbo jet freighter estimated to deliver cargo valued at $3 million on average| this is expected to drive hundreds of millions in economic benefit for the City and surrounding region. In addition to the new capacity afforded by the northeast cargo campus| Chicago’s surge in cargo activity is due in large part to its central geography and strong network of transportation infrastructure. Chicago has surpassed its large hub peer airports as the top destination for air trade with China| and trade with Asian countries continues to grow each year as new capacity becomes available at O’Hare. The northeast cargo development follows on a series of initiatives by the Emanuel Administration to invest in the modernization of O’Hare. The City recently announced the establishment of a new| uniform rate structure for aeronautical real estate leases at O’Hare International Airport that will generate $41 million in additional annual revenue for the City to invest in airport improvement projects at O’Hare. Also expected to expand capacity and establish modern facilities for O’Hare’s future is Mayor Emanuel’s O’Hare 21 vision—a multi-billion capital program designed to modernize terminals| expand gates| and improve connectivity at O'Hare. O'Hare 21 is expected to support tens of thousands of new jobs| add to incentives for companies to relocate| and further increase economic activity throughout the region.,August 17| 2017
210,Statement from Mayor Rahm Emanuel| CPS CEO Forrest Claypool and CPS Chief Education Officer Janice Jackson,“At the same time the President of the United States is throwing his arms around neo-Nazis and Klansmen| Governor Rauner’s brain trust at the Illinois Policy Institute weighed in on the SB1 debate by publishing an unambiguously racist cartoon. The critical debate over education funding in this state should be about ensuring a better future for students in every corner of Illinois| regardless of race| income or zip code – and not as an opportunity to divide us further. It’s particularly frustrating because CPS students are making historic academic gains. In fact| three CPS high schools were recently recognized among the top 10 in the country| and seven of the top 10 in the state. Over the past five years| virtually all of Illinois’ academic progress is attributable to Chicago’s students.,August 16| 2017
211,Mayor Emanuel Announces Decreasing Breast Health Disparities for Chicago's African American Women,Mayor Emanuel and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) today announced advances in breast health outcomes for African American women in Chicago. Chicago demonstrated the most progress in reducing racial disparities in breast cancer mortality compared to nine other cities with the largest African American population in the U.S.| according to a new study published in Cancer Causes & Control| an international journal of studies of cancer in human populations.“Chicago is showing the nation that when you work together to improve health| we can make a difference|” Mayor Emanuel said. “Even with this progress| there is more work to be done. Every woman regardless of race or income deserves access to life-saving prevention and treatment services and we will not stop until that goal is achieved.” Between 1999 and 2013| the mortality rate from breast cancer among African American women in Chicago decreased by 13.9%. The disparity between African American and white women has been reduced by more than 20% during the same time frame. “Alleviating structural inequity is a key component of Healthy Chicago 2.0|” said Chicago Department of Public Health| Julie Morita| M.D. “Identifying the obstacles faced by African American women and working to remove them is how we save lives.”To further closer this gap| CDPH is investing $700|000 in community partners to increase comprehensive breast health services for African American women and others who have faced historical obstacles to access. CDPH is partnering with Cook County Health and Hospital System| Rush University Medical Center| Mile Square Health Center of University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System| Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force (MBCTF)| Sinai Health System and Centro Comunitario Juan Diego to increase breast cancer screenings and ensure that high-risk| medically underserved women receive high quality follow up and treatment. These new investments help meet the goals outlined Healthy Chicago 2.0| the citywide health improvement plan| which includes increasing breast cancer screenings among older females by 5% and reducing breast cancer mortality among African Americans by 10%.Even with this progress| disparities remain as African American women in Chicago have a breast cancer mortality rate 50% higher than Non-Hispanic White women despite similar rates of diagnoses. Public health officials and community partners recognize that structural inequities may lead to minority and low-income women to receive lower quality mammography services resulting in later stage diagnosis and poorer prognosis. Implementing targeted outreach and patient-supported healthcare navigation initiatives can help address these disparities| leading to earlier diagnosis and improved healthcare outcomes.,August 16| 2017
212,Mayor Emanuel Issues Executive Order to Require City's Largest Construction Projects Commit to Hiring Diverse Workforce,Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago Department of Planning and Development Commissioner David Reifman today announced many of the city’s largest construction projects will now be required to report on their efforts to solicit and hire minority- and women-owned business (MBE/WBE). The action was taken through an executive order signed today by Mayor Emanuel. “For too long many major development projects have reshaped our neighborhoods without employing the people who live in them|” Mayor Emanuel said. “This order will help ensure these major projects not only help to build Chicago| but also support the diverse mix of families that call it home.” The executive order requires developers seeking Planned Development (PD) zoning approvals by the Chicago Plan Commission to submit signed affidavits about their efforts to promote and incorporate participation by certified MBE/WBE firms and plans for local hiring.  The affidavits are to be provided at three different stages during the development process: ,August 16| 2017
213,CPD Superintendent Johnson Welcomes 111 New Police Recruits,Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago Police Department (CPD) Superintendent Eddie Johnson welcomed today 111 new police recruits to the Department's Training Academy| the eighth class of new recruits this year as part of the Department’s hiring plan to add nearly 1|000 officers. As part of the hiring plan| applications open today for candidates who want the opportunity to take the CPD Entry Exam and apply to become a Chicago police officer.  “I’m immensely proud and grateful of the new police recruits who will work with our communities| block-by-block to ensure every street corner in all 77 neighborhoods belong to the children and families of Chicago|” said Mayor Emanuel. “The new class will be trained on the history of our diverse communities and our new use of force policy which focuses on de-escalation of conflict.” The August class of recruits will benefit from new training opportunities initiated this year as part of the Departments reform efforts and commitment to rebuilding trust through training that reflects the city’s values and cultural heritage. These training include| the Department's new use of force policies released this past May following month of public input| a new cultural awareness training at the DuSable Museum of African American History. The August class is 20% women and includes 60% minority recruits. In addition| eight are military veterans.  "I am proud to welcome the next generation of Chicago police officers who will be part of our efforts to provide better service to all Chicagoans and more effectively combat crime|" said CPD Superintendent Eddie Johnson. "We are committed to investing in our personnel and training to give us the resources we need to make our city and our officers safer.",August 15| 2017
214,Mayor Emanuel Opens Reconstructed Six-Way Interchange at Damen| Elston and Fullerton Avenues,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today cut the ribbon to open a reconstructed and modernized intersection at Damen| Elston and Fullerton Avenues| one of the city’s most congestion-plagued traffic hotspots. The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) project realigned the intersection by building a new section of Elston Avenue that connects to Fullerton Avenue east of the original intersection. The realignment allows southeast bound Elston traffic to avoid the Damen and Fullerton intersection| significantly reducing congestion.  “For decades the intersection at Damen| Elston and Fullerton has been one of the most dangerous and congested in Chicago|” Mayor Emanuel said. “This major project is a win-win| it has created jobs and economic opportunities across the city and delivered a fully rebuilt and redesigned intersection that is moving traffic more smoothly and safely.” The new stretch of Elston Avenue includes two through lanes for vehicle traffic and protected bike lanes in both directions. Improvements also included the resurfacing of all streets within the project limits| widening Damen to improve traffic flow and better accommodate bikes| and widening the north sidewalk along Fullerton. The project will include the planting of 162 new trees| with about 50 planted to date and the rest planted in the fall. “More than 70|000 vehicles pass through this intersection each day| and at peak travel times it used to cause major inconvenience for motorists as well as pedestrians and bicyclists|” CDOT Commissioner Rebekah Scheinfeld said. “We implemented a creative solution that has rerouted Elston and synchronized traffic signals to relieve congestion| improving safety for everyone who travels through the area.” The old section of Elston south of Fullerton was renamed N. Elston Court and has been reconstructed with access at Fullerton| and with traffic calming bumpouts at Winchester. The project also created space for commercial development on both the north side and the south side of Fullerton east of Damen.  The project was originally included in the North Branch North TIF Redevelopment Plan| to facilitate economic development. Several success stories are already evident from this improvement| including the adjacent $75 million renovation of the Midtown Athletic Club| which is completing construction of a new boutique hotel later this year. Vienna Beef was able to relocate its manufacturing facility and 250 jobs to another location in Chicago and is actively reconfiguring the use of the former plant to include retail and restaurant space. AndWhirlyBall| the popular entertainment complex| has relocated to a new facility in the area at Webster just east of Damen. “Completion of the Damen| Elston| Fullerton project is exciting news for the many Chicagoans who rely on our city's connected transportation system|" said Rep. Quigley. "The addition of a new traffic intersection| as well as safe| accessible  bike lanes| will reduce congestion and allow families to get from point A to point B quickly and efficiently. Forward-thinking improvements and investments like these will continue to strengthen our infrastructure and improve the lives of those who call Chicago home." The $22.5 million construction cost was paid for through federal| state| and local funds and was managed by CDOT in coordination with the Illinois Department of Transportation. You can follow CDOT on digital media:Twitter:  @ChicagoDOTFacebook: www.facebook.com/CDOTNewsThe web: chicagodot.org,August 14| 2017
215,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on the Passing of Police Captain James Lavoy,"Our hearts are heavy today as we mourn the loss of Chicago Police Department Captain James Lavoy. Over the nearly three decades he served our city| Captain Lavoy received more than 65 commendations| awards and honorable mentions.

216,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on the State Senate's Override of Governor Rauner's Education Funding Veto,“Governor Rauner's education funding veto brought together rural| suburban and urban educators and legislators in bipartisan opposition to the governor and in support of today's veto override. This diverse group of educators and leaders knows the Senate's education bill is right for Illinois children and the governor's veto is flat wrong. I want to thank Senate President Cullerton and the state Senators who voted on behalf of students and educators. The Senate's vote is a bipartisan rejection of the governor’s divisive politics and of his repeated attempts to pit children with different backgrounds and from different parts of the state against one another.” ,August 13| 2017
217,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on Charlottesville,"We are saddened by the ongoing events in Charlottesville| and our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Virginia.

As one of our nation’s greatest voices for justice and peace| Martin Luther King Jr.| reminded us all| ‘we must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.’”,August 12| 2017
218,Community Policing Advisory Panel Releases Draft Recommendations,The Chicago Police Department (CPD) Superintendent Eddie Johnson today announced the release of the first draft of recommendations from the Superintendent’s Community Policing Advisory Panel as part of the Department’s continued reform efforts to rebuild trust with residents and strengthen public safety in every neighborhood of the city.

220,Mayor Emanuel and CPS Announce Record High Reading and Math Scores on National Exam,Mayor Emanuel| CPS CEO Forrest Claypool and CPS Chief Education Officer Dr. Janice K. Jackson today announced that more Chicago elementary students than ever before are meeting or exceeding standards for math and reading. For the fifth year in a row| CPS students have outscored national peers in both subjects.  A record 61.4 percent of students met or exceeded the national testing average in reading and 55.9 percent of students met or exceeded the average in math on the 2016-17 Northwest Evaluation Association Measures of Academic Progress (NWEA MAP) exam. NWEA MAP measured the academic achievement of more than 8 million students in grades 2 through 8 at more than 7|800 schools and districts across the country. “For the fifth year in a row| CPS students are meeting or beating the national average in both reading and math|” said Mayor Emanuel. “Record setting achievements like NWEA results are proof that when we raise the bar for Chicago’s students| they take pride in meeting and beating our expectations.” The percentage of CPS students meeting and exceeding the national average has increased by 34.6 percent in reading and 23.9 percent in math since 2013. With consistent gains over the past five years| CPS students are scoring higher in reading and math than their national peers. “Again| independent national data shows that Chicago students are learning and achieving at record breaking levels|” said CPS Chief Executive Officer Claypool. “By investing in schools and the resources our students need to be successful| CPS is working to put all of Chicago’s students on a path to success.” CPS students also continue to exceed national growth averages in reading and math. In 2017| 60.4 percent of students met or exceeded national averages for reading growth| and 56.7 percent of students met or exceeded averages for math growth. Any rate above 50 percent exceeds the national average for growth and signifies the substantial progress CPS students continue to make. “Chicago students have outscored their national peers for five years in a row| and we’re building on that momentum to make sure we are preparing every CPS student for success| “said CPS Chief Education Officer Jackson.  “Chicago students are breaking down barriers| changing mindsets and redefining what low income and students of color can accomplish when given the opportunity and support to succeed.”  At several CPS schools| more than 95 percent of students met or exceeded national averages in both reading and math. These schools included Lane Technical College Prep High School| Whitney M. Young Magnet High School| Annie Keller Regional Gifted Center| Skinner North Classical School| Decatur Classical Elementary School| James E. McDade Classical School| William Howard Taft High School| Kenwood Academy High School and Edison Regional Gifted Center. The NWEA results are only the latest example in several independently confirmed data points that show the tremendous improvements and remarkable achievements they are making. Most recently| a study from the University of Illinois – Chicago’s Center for Urban Education Leadership showed that Chicago students outperform their Illinois peers in every major racial and socioeconomic group.  This study came on the heels of research from Stanford University’s Sean Reardon| who found that Chicago students improve academically faster than any large urban school system in the country.  Since 2011| CPS students continue to make historic gains across a wide range of significant milestones such as “the Nation’s Report Card.” According to NAEP| CPS students were among the national leaders in gains for both eighth grade math and fourth grade reading on the national benchmark assessment in 2015.  Eighth grade CPS students achieved the greatest growth in the nation among their urban peers in math| registering growth of 6 scale-score points since 2013. Fourth graders achieved the third highest growth in the nation among their urban peers in reading with growth of 7 scale-score points since 2013. Chicago was one of only three urban districts – joining Cleveland and Miami-Dade – to have experienced academic growth in math and reading in both the fourth and eighth grades in 2015. Students have achieved historic gains in freshmen-on-track to graduate rates| as well as graduating high school and enrolling in college in record numbers.  The CPS graduation rate has climbed by more than 16 points since 2011 to 73.5 percent in 2016| and is growing more than three times faster than the national rate in the same time frame. In the same time frame| ACT scores have increased by 1.2 points across all district schools. Graduation rates have been driven in part by the district’s focus on its freshman on track to graduate rate| which was 87.4% in 2016 and up from 69% in 2011.  Mayor Emanuel and CPS continue to support student advancements by making significant investments to improve education. The transition in 2012 to the full school day and full school year ensured that students in all schools receive high levels of math and literacy instruction. CPS is also in the process of developing curriculum and sequencing for schools to adopt| expanding academic enrichment opportunities| like chess and debate| providing professional development opportunities and leveraging university partnerships to continue to implement evidence-based policies to put our students on the path to success.  Chicago Public Schools serves 381|000 students in 652 schools. It is the nation’s third-largest school district. ,August 10| 2017

224,Mayor Emanuel Congratulates Youth on Completing 2017 Summer Jobs Program,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today joined One Summer Chicago youth working at an urban garden job site to congratulate them on completing the 2017 jobs program. For the past seven weeks| 31|000 youth ages 14-24 have been working at similar work sites across the City in opportunities ranging from food service to hospital work to computer programming and more. “These opportunities were more than a job.

You made a commitment; put in the time and have taken an important step forward on your path to future success.”  About 30 youth participated in the Growing Power urban garden program at Roosevelt Square Farm this summer.

For several youth| employment in the private sector will extend beyond the summer with Potbelly’s hiring about 25 of its youth participants and the Hilton hiring five youth who graduated from their 30-hour hospitality curriculum.     “Not only are youth gaining summer employment and life skills| but some private sector businesses are stepping up and hiring our youth on a more permanent basis|” said Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS) Commissioner Lisa Morrison Butler. “This shows that One Summer Chicago is so much more than just a summer jobs program.The Infrastructure Team| a subset of One Summer Chicago| employed nearly 600 youth again this summer.

227,Mayor Emanuel Announces Latest Efforts to Protect Southeast Side Residents from Manganese,Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) announced today that the City is expanding efforts to reduce manganese exposure to residents on the Southeast side. In order to hold producers accountable to the communities where they operate| a new study is investigating all companies who may use manganese and the impact to residents’ health in the area. The city is also increasing scrutiny of company manganese control and evaluating options for further action to those who violate local and federal standards. "Holding these companies accountable is about protecting the health of our children| our communities and our environment|" said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. "Just as we held petcoke handlers to high standards| we will ensure that companies either clean up or shut down."  The new study| conducted by a retained consultant| will include modeling of particulate matter| soil and air sampling near homes in the area and an assessment of the potential health risks to residents."Ensuring that residents are breathing clean air is our top priority|" said Chicago Department of Public Health| Commissioner Dr. Julie Morita. "We are committed to completing thorough and rigorous study so we are able to then make data-informed regulatory recommendations as needed."  In addition to CDPH’s routine inspections and continued monitoring for any off-site dust| the City will evaluate if increased dust control measures for bulk material handlers would lead to decreased manganese exposure for residents. The City will also begin increased inspections of S.H. Bell and other industrial sites on Chicago’s Southeast Side. "The people of the Southeast Side have a long and proud history. We will not allow any company| no matter how big| to put the health and safety of our community at risk|" said Alderman Garza| 10th ward. "We will continue to work together| with city leaders and community activists| to ensure our air| water and soil are clean." Manganese is a naturally occurring element that is used in steel production. Very small amounts can be found in soil| coal and other resources throughout the U.S. Manganese is an essential nutrient and intake from dietary sources such as whole grains and green leafy vegetables is necessary to maintain normal health. Direct| ongoing inhalation of large amounts of manganese can be hazardous. Chicago’s current bulk material regulations— for storage and handling—are among the strongest in the nation.  Presently| companies that manage bulk materials are required to have fugitive dust plans| which outline dust control measures| such as sprinklers and enclosures| as well as air monitors to ensure the measures are working. Today’s developments build upon the Mayor’s previous efforts to protect residents and the environment from harmful pollutants. In April 2014| the City Council of Chicago passed an ordinance to ban new petcoke| coke and coal facilities and prohibit the expansion of existing facilities.,August 7| 2017
228,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on the Passing of Don Baylor,“Today| baseball lost a genuine class act. I join the City of Chicago in mourning the loss of Don Baylor| not just a great Cubs manager but a great man. He lived his life with the same unflinching toughness with which he approached the batter’s box – unafraid to take a hit. Baseball| and the world| has lost a respected clubhouse leader and an accomplished athlete with the rare distinction of playing in three consecutive World Series with three different teams. Amy and I send our prayers and condolences to the Baylor family.”,August 7| 2017
229,Mayor Emanuel| City of Chicago File Federal Lawsuit to Prevent President Trump's Justice Department from Making Federal Crime Prevention Grants Conditional on Unrelated Immigration Enforcement Actions,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced that the City of Chicago has filed a federal lawsuit to prevent President Donald Trump's Justice Department from making a federal crime prevention grant that is critical to public safety efforts conditional on unrelated and unlawful immigration enforcement actions. “Community policing is a guiding philosophy of the Chicago Police Department| but it cannot succeed when a segment of the community is afraid to cooperate or communicate with the police|” said Mayor Emanuel. “Chicago is a welcoming City and always will be| and we will not be blackmailed by President Trump's Justice Department. Forcing us to choose between our values and our Police Department’s philosophy of community policing is a false choice| and it is a choice that would ultimately undermine our public safety agenda.” Mayor Emanuel| Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel and Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson announced the City’s intent to file the lawsuit at a press conference yesterday; video of the press conference can be found at https://livestream.com/chicagosmayor/press/videos/160878814. View a copy of the federal lawsuit that was filed today:,August 7| 2017
230,Mayor Emanuel| City of Chicago File Federal Lawsuit to Prevent President Trump's Justice Department from Making Federal Crime Prevention Grants Conditional on Unrelated Immigration Enforcement Actions,Mayor Rahm Emanuel| Chicago Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel and Chicago Police Department (CPD) Superintendent Eddie Johnson announced that on Monday the City of Chicago will file a federal lawsuit to prevent President Donald Trump's Justice Department from making a federal crime prevention grant that is critical to public safety efforts conditional on unrelated and unlawful immigration enforcement actions. “Chicago will not be blackmailed into changing our values| and we are and will remain a welcoming City|” said Mayor Emanuel. “The federal government should be working with cities to provide necessary resources to improve public safety| not concocting new schemes to reduce our crime fighting resources. The City of Chicago will continue to stand up to President Trump and his Justice Department to ensure that their misguided policies do not threaten the safety of our residents.” On Thursday| August 3| 2017| the U.S. Department of Justice published the application for FY2017 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program| which provides states and cities with federal funding to support local law enforcement efforts. Unlike previous applications| this year’s iteration requires that new conditions be met by local municipalities in order to be eligible for grant funding. These conditions include the certification of compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373| a federal statute that bars restrictions on federal-local sharing of immigration status information; unlimited access to local police stations and law enforcement facilities by U.S. Department of Homeland Security personnel to interrogate arrestees; and the requirement that cities provide DHS with at least a 48 hour notice prior to an arrestee’s release| which would require detaining residents longer than is permissible under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. These conditions effectively federalize local detention facilities and violate the Fourth Amendment in instances where detainees are otherwise lawfully eligible for release from police custody. Over the years| Chicago has used Byrne JAG funds for a variety of purposes that benefit public safety| including the purchase of SWAT equipment| police vehicles| radios and tasers. Last year| the City of Chicago received $2.3 million in Byrne JAG funds. As part of the suit| the City asks the court to declare the Attorney General’s actions in imposing the new conditions unlawful and that Chicago and its Welcoming City ordinance are in compliance with all valid and applicable federal laws. “We are filing this suit because the Attorney General does not have the authority to add these requirements to a grant program created by Congress and cannot commandeer local law enforcement to carry out federal immigration law functions|” said Corporation Counsel Siskel. “We are asking the court to ensure that we are not forced to either forego critical grant funds or agree to new conditions| which violate the Constitution and our Welcoming City ordinance.” Chicago’s Welcoming City ordinance prioritizes effective local law enforcement and crime prevention over federal civil immigration issues. This ordinance promotes public safety by ensuring that no city resident| regardless of their status| is afraid to cooperate with law enforcement| report criminal activity to the police| serve as a witness in court| or seek help as a victim of crime. “The federal government has been an effective partner in the crime fight| as funding and additional federal agents have greatly helped us to take guns off the streets and make our communities safer|” said Superintendent Johnson. "Removing those resources| regardless of the reason| makes CPD's mission to protect all residents in Chicago that much more difficult." Applications for FY2017 Byrne Grants are due on September 5| 2017. The Byrne JAG program is named for Edward Byrne| a New York City police officer who was murdered in 1988 while on assignment protecting a Guyanese immigrant who had reported illegal activity to police. The City of Chicago is being supported in its legal efforts on this issue by two outside law firms| Riley Safer and Wilmer Hale| who are providing their services pro bono.,August 6| 2017

To provide context and lend brain power| the teams were joined by current Chicago high school students from the Young Women’s Leadership Academy of Chicago| Butler College Prep| Urban Prep and Thornwood High School.  Pitch Black was formed as an independent project by Harvard Business School graduates Anthony Tucker| Benjamin Cole and Luthan Hill to positively impact their community. Working with Dwyane Wade| who had a mutual interest in and track record of giving back to the African American community| and the Wade’s World Foundation| Pitch Black created the inaugural hackathon to propose innovative solutions for Chicago.  ,August 4| 2017

Throop St.Following a competitive bidding process| the City has reached a tentative agreement to sell the 18-acre Department of Fleet and Facilities management to local developer Sterling Bay for $104.7 million| or $133.53 per square foot. The site was marketed on behalf of the City by Cushman & Wakefield. Closing is expected to occur later this year.  At least $20 million of the sale of 1685 N. Throop St. will go towards the Public Safety Training Academy| which will pay for the purchase of the land and get work started. The estimated cost for the proposed Public Safety Training Academy| including land acquisition| is $95 million. The City will work with the Chicago Infrastructure Trust to select a developer to design| build and finance the project.,July 30| 2017

It is an essential service that we provide to ensure that litter and debris is constantly swept and disposed of| making our roadways safe and passable| and keeping our neighborhoods cleaner.” Street sweepers sweep the main and residential streets to ensure that curb lanes are litter free. Sweeping also plays an important role in ensuring catch basins and viaducts are clutter-free| which helps prevent street flooding during major storms.  In 2017| milder conditions also allowed DSS to continue street cleaning along curb lanes| center lanes and viaducts during the winter months.   In January| DSS swept 4|359 miles| compared to the 275 miles in January 2016.  In February| DSS swept 6|044 miles compared to 1|548 miles in February 2016. DSS| along with the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT)| were in the area as part of a neighborhood service blitz. The blitz program began earlier this summer and delivers a targeted amount of resources to a community.    Crews have been out in the South Chicago neighborhood since Thursday cleaning vacant lots| addressing graffiti and rodent complaints| trimming trees| replacing broken street lights| filling potholes and more. As part of the blitz program| to date this year| City workers have filled more than 2|750 potholes; hauled away almost 2|500 bags of debris;  repaired or replaced more than 1|000 traffic and street signs;  graffiti blasted nearly 300 areas; replaced almost 150 burned-out streetlights| repainted 225 crosswalks| and towed over 100 abandoned cars.  The Neighborhood Blitz program will continue until the fall in neighborhoods throughout Chicago.   The street sweeping season will continue through November| weather permitting.

245,Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities Launches Task Force on Employment and Economic Opportunity for People with Disabilities,Mayor Emanuel and Commissioner of the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities Karen Tamley today launched a new task force focused on removing employment barriers for people with disabilities. The Task Force on Employment and Economic Opportunity for People with Disabilities will advise the city on relevant policies and programs in order to increase employment and economic development opportunities to benefit residents with disabilities. The task force launches on the 27th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)| which was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush on July 26| 1990.“Residents across Chicago deserve the necessary access to opportunities across the city|” said Mayor Emanuel. “While I am proud of the commitments and progress we have made for individuals with disabilities| there is more to be done. The Task Force on Employment and Economic Opportunity for People with Disabilities will help to ensure that individuals have an equal opportunity to earn a good wage and to live independently.” The Task Force brings together leaders of not-for-profit disability policy organizations| community- based service providers| universities and higher education to discuss the employment gap and economic growth opportunities in the region| and city and state. Leaders will work to advance policies and programs that better prepare students with disabilities for higher education; increase alignment on job training opportunities between employers and service providers; and encourage economic development through entrepreneurship. They will also review new and existing policies to ensure that the interests of people with disabilities are represented. "I understand the barriers Chicagoans with disabilities face to employment| and I am proud to convene this unparalleled group of leaders to address the very real employment gap|” said Commissioner of the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities Karen Tamley. “The Task Force on Employment and Economic Opportunity for People with Disabilities is uniquely qualified to address this issue head-on| and to ensure that residents are afforded the same opportunities to live| work and thrive across the city.”The Task Force was created by Mayor Rahm Emanuel| Commissioner Tamley and Alderman Roberto Maldonado to increase employment and economic development opportunities for people with disabilities. This is a critical step in being able to live independently| accessing quality education| job training| transportation| and housing. Creation of the task force delivers on the administration’s ongoing commitment to improving access and opportunity for disabled residents in a wide range of city initiatives| with a focus on education and employment. Under the Mayor’s leadership| MOPD has launched a number of initiatives focused on improving opportunities for people with disabilities to earn an education and gain employment. The City’s first Mayoral Literacy Task Force was launched in 2015 in an effort to close the gap in literacy and improve reading proficiency among students and residents with disabilities.The Task Force launches on the 27th Anniversary of the landmark civil rights legislation| The Americans with Disabilities Act. The ADA was signed into law| with the purpose of providing a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities. Since its inception| Chicago has been a long-term leader in disability rights with a robust community of actively engaged disability advocacy leaders and groups. While a series of both local and federal legislation| including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)| have contributed to significant improvements in quality of life in recent years| people with disabilities| who make up approximately one fifth of the population in Chicago| are still unemployed at higher rates and are more impacted by poverty than those without disabilities. Since 2011| the City of Chicago has installed over 91|000 ADA compliant curb ramps| provided disability accessibility at close to 70 percent of CTA stations| and has included the needs of people with disabilities into all city emergency plans. The city plans to strengthen access for individuals with disabilities in the areas of transportation| cultural institutions| education and employment. This includes plans to increase accessibility at CTA rail stations from 70 percent to 100 percent| additional access to fitness equipment at city parks| taxicab reforms and incentives to increase the number of accessible vehicles.,July 26| 2017

247,Statement on President Trump's Ban on Transgender People from Military Service,"On the 69th anniversary of President Truman’s order to integrate the military| President Trump has come down on the wrong side of history. He is choosing to divide us rather than unite us. Brave Americans who seek to selflessly serve this country in uniform should have the opportunity to answer the call to service| regardless of their identity.

292,Chicago Teams Compete to Improve Lake Erie's Water Quality,CHICAGO| Illinois (June 21| 2017) – Today| two teams of Chicago-based innovators| data scientists| and designers are competing in the semi-finals of the 2017 AquaHacking Challenge – an annual event focused on using technology to improve Great Lakes water quality. The two teams are the only U.S. representatives advancing to the semi-finals on June 21 and will face 16 other teams from Canada and the Netherlands.“We have a shared responsibility to do what we can to protect the Great Lakes. And the AquaHacking Challenge is a great way to engage top minds in finding solutions to address the issues facing our waterways|” said Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “I want to commend our local teams for the work they have done and will be cheering them on as they compete in the semi-finals.”The AquaHacking competition| presented by the Canadian de Gaspé Beaubien Foundation| focuses on a different Great Lake each year. This year’s event aims to reduce threats to Lake Erie from urban areas| agriculture and industry. “We are thrilled to see teams from Chicago participate in this year’s AquaHacking Challenge.” Said de Gaspé Beaubien Foundation Executive Director Claude Perras. “A partner like the City of Chicago  is key to our mission of championing emerging clean-tech innovation and entrepreneurship while creating opportunities for the rising generation to engage in dialogue across sectors| jurisdictions and generations to develop integrated strategies for water policy and governance which will benefit both Canada and the US.” Chicago’s teams are working to combat toxic algae| a major threat to the lake’s ecosystem| and engage citizens in monitoring water quality. Toxic algal blooms are caused when warm water combines with high concentrations of phosphorus from urban wastewater and fertilizer that runs off from farmland. These harmful algal blooms can produce toxins that threaten drinking water supplies and aquatic habitats.One of the teams| comprised of data science students from Illinois Tech| is creating a “Boaters Tracking Blooms Data Collection Program” that works with boaters to collect images and sensor data on algal blooms. They will use the date to improve models for predicting when and where algal blooms grow. The other team| Team “Data Drops|” created an open-source database that collects water quality data to map the Great Lakes watershed and share information with the public and other organizations. Current| Chicago’s accelerator of innovative water research and technology development| is coordinating Chicago’s AquaHacking teams.“Harnessing innovation to solve Lake Erie’s challenges is of great value to the Great Lakes Basin|” said Steve Frenkel| Current’s executive director. “Current is excited to support the AquaHacking Challenge because it provides a platform for Chicago’s talented scientists| programmers| and students to leverage their skills to protect critical water resources.”After the semi-finals| five teams will advance to the finals on September 13. There is $75|000 CAD in prizes available for winning teams| as well as access to consultation and mentorship. “Win or lose| this is a step forward for Chicago’s innovation community toward building the skills and community to participate in future AquaHacking Challenges|” Frenkel said.Current is working in partnership with Microsoft| Illinois Institute of Design| the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship| Uptake| and West Monroe Partners on this effort.In Chicago| the recently extended 1.25 mile Riverwalk and the completion of a fourth boat house along the Chicago River demonstrates the Mayor's commitment to increase access to and recreational opportunities on the river| as outlined in both his Building on Burnham plan and Our Great Rivers| a forward looking action agenda for Chicago's three rivers.About Current: Current propels Chicago’s water economy to solve global water challenges. Current connects the city’s world-class public water utilities| private industry| research institutions| and entrepreneurs to promote innovation for greater sustainability and economic growth. Through Current| Chicagoland will become a global leader in the development and deployment of next-generation water technology.

293,Annual Rahm's Readers Summer Learning Challenge Launches at Chicago Public Library,Chicago Public Library (CPL) Commissioner Brian Bannon and First Lady Amy Rule today kicked off Rahm’s Readers Summer Learning Challenge| which will take place citywide in all 80 library locations. Rahm’s Readers 2017 has a super hero theme and will engage students in learning and brain-stimulating activities. CPL and the City of Chicago are teaming up with the Museum of Science and Industry to challenge Chicago’s children to read 20 minutes a day and participate in STEAM (Science| Technology| Engineering| Art and Math) activities which are critical to the success of 21st century learners.

Through CPL’s strategic partnership with the Museum of Science and Industry| the Summer Learning Challenge embeds STEAM programming as a vital track of learning in the summer months. Program participants are encouraged to engage in various critical thinking| creation and design activities to encourage creativity| problem solving and persistence. Rahm’s Readers Summer Learning Challenge continues to receive national recognition. In 2015| Chicago Public Library was the first-ever winner of National Summer Learning Association’s Founder’s Award for Excellence| in recognition of the revamped Summer Learning Challenge. CPL is the only public library ever to win an award from the NSLA. Due to the program’s success| CPL’s Director of System Wide Children’s Services Elizabeth McChesney co-authored “Summer Matters: Making All Learning Count” (ALA Publications| June 2017)| a guide based on the Library’s approach to summer learning with partner institution MSI.“We are proud of our Summer Learning Challenge and the recognition it’s received|” said Commissioner Brian Bannon. “With support from the Chicago Public Library Foundation| our strong partnerships and innovative staff| we’re able to offer programming in all 80 branches to help Chicago kids in every neighborhood prevent summer slide.”Additionally| Chicago Public Library and the Museum of Science and Industry earned a Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian grant for $300|000 from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.

294,Mayor Emanuel Announces Climate Summit for North American Cities to be Held in Chicago,Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced today that Chicago will partner with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy and all of its partner city networks to host a climate summit for North American cities in the late fall. The summit will bring together Mayors from across the United States| Canada| and Mexico to outline each city’s respective commitments to the Paris Agreement on climate change via new programs and initiatives. “Now| more than ever| cities are leading on bold and innovative initiatives that not only reduce our carbon footprint but also help develop a 21st century economy|” said Mayor Emanuel. “By partnering with the Global Covenant of Mayors and other city networks| we are ready to show the world that we will not wait on others to forge our destiny to more sustainable and more productive cities.” Chaired by UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change Michael R. Bloomberg| Vice President of the European Commission Maroš Šefčovič| and former Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Christiana Figueres| the Global Covenant of Mayors is an international alliance of more than 7|400 cities and local governments| all of whom have committed to meet or exceed the planned contributions of their respective national governments to the meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.  “The Global Covenant of Mayors is excited partner with Mayor Emmanuel and the City of Chicago on this important summit that will showcase the remarkable city leadership on climate change that has emerged in North America|” said Christiana Figueres of the Global Covenant. “Cities around the world should take note that action to support national governments meet and exceed their Paris commitments is in their economic and environmental self-interest"  Mayors gathering in Chicago will commit themselves and their cities to moving forward with emissions reductions regardless of action taken by their respective federal governments. In addition| Mayors will announce city-specific climate programs and policies over the next several years and commit to working through existing organizations| such as Climate Mayors| the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group| and ICLEI to develop partnerships with other cities. Along with the Global Covenant of Mayors| the Joyce Foundation and John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation have agreed to serve as initial supporters of the Summit. “For decades| the Joyce Foundation has been committed to protecting the environment in the Great Lakes region|” said Ellen S. Alberding| President of the Joyce Foundation. “We are proud that Chicago will be hosting Mayors from across North America and leading important conversations about local solutions to the threat of climate change.” “Leadership is the essential ingredient in combatting the effects of climate change|” said Julia Stasch| President of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. “As our national government turns its back on this critical global challenge| this summit is strong evidence that leadership increasingly is coming from local governments| along with states and the business community.” Since the Trump administration’s announcement to pull out of the Paris Agreements| cities across the United States and around of the world have shown their commitment to creating a truly sustainable future for their residents. Over the past several weeks| Mayor Emanuel has joined more than 270 Climate Mayors from cities across the United States in the commitment to adopt| honor and uphold the Paris Agreement. Hundreds of US cities| universities| and businesses have declared “We Are Still In” regarding pursuing ambitious climate goals| and ensuring that the US remains a global leader in reducing emissions. This group is now working on the creation of “America’s Pledge|” an unprecedented effort to aggregate carbon reductions by cities| regions and businesses to ensure that the US achieves its Paris Agreement pledge. In April| the Mayor announced that by 2025 all of Chicago’s public buildings will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. That transition means that eight percent of the city-wide electricity load or 1.8 billion kilowatt hours will come from clean and renewable sources. This follows the 2013 commitment that the City made to eliminating coal from its electricity supply. Earlier this year| the City of Chicago was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2017 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award. The award is given annually to honor organizations that have made outstanding contributions to protecting the environment through energy efficiency and recognized the Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenge and its 76 member buildings covering 51.3 million square feet-all of which have committed to reducing their energy use by 20 percent. The award also recognized the four years of successful implementation of the City’s Energy Benchmarking Ordinance which has reduced energy use by four percent in buildings covered by the ordinance. There are several city-based climate initiatives and organizations performing great work in North America and across the globe| which this convening will not aim to supplant or replicate. Rather| the convening creates an opportunity for those organizations and their members to come together for a single event| nearly two years after the signing of the Paris Agreement| to send a powerful message of the important of climate issues and a critical time| with the legacy work of the convening occurring through existing institutions. Climate change is not just an issue for megacities or cities on sea coasts. From extreme weather events to warmer temperatures to threats to water quality the impacts of climate change can be seen throughout America’s heartland| in cities of all size. The goal of the convening is to have a representative group of participating cities taking leadership on climate| regardless of population| political affiliation| or geography. Chicago’s leadership on the environment and convenient location and connectivity make it the most suitable choice. Additional details| including date and other events associated with the Summit| will be announced in the coming weeks.,June 21| 2017

316,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on Paris Accord,"The President’s decision to pull out of the Paris Accord is a poor attempt to pit environmental protection and economic growth against each other. It’s a false choice. Chicago has proven you can create jobs while reducing your carbon footprint| and we will continue to do both. As the Trump administration pulls back we will push forward and reduce our fair share of carbon emissions in line with the Paris Accord. The world is depending on cities in the US to take up the mantle of leadership on climate change. Chicago will happily accept that challenge."In January Mayor Emanuel announced that Chicago has reduced its carbon emissions by 7% from 2010 to 2015| according to a new analysis. This reduction in greenhouse gases came at the same time Chicago saw a 25|000 person increase in its population and 12 percent growth in the region’s economy and jobs within the city. The emissions reduction| equivalent to shutting down a coal power plant for 8 months| compares to a 1 percentage increase in nationwide emissions from 2009 to 2014.The preliminary analysis| developed by AECOM| and the first 2015 emissions inventory for any major North America city| estimated Chicago generated 30.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2015| compared to 33.3 million in 2010.

We will work with cities around the country to reduce our emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement| and urge President Trump to keep our nation’s commitment as well.”Background:,May 31| 2017

321,Mayor Emanuel Announces Teen Birthrate at Historic Low,Mayor Emanuel and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) today announced teen births are at a historic low in Chicago. This milestone comes after eight consecutive years of decline. In 2014| the most recent year for which data is available| there were 32 births per 1|000 females aged 15-19 years old| more than a 62 percent drop from the 85.2 rate in 1999. Even though Chicago’s teen birth rate is higher than the national average| which is also dropping| that gap is closing as Chicago’s teen birthrate has dropped 20 percent more than national rates.   “This is an important step in the right direction as Chicago continues to work towards fewer teen births|” Mayor Emanuel said. “Every teen in this city deserves resources and education so they can make informed choices.” While Chicago has seen declines in teen births across all racial and ethnic groups since 2010| African American teens have seen the most compelling decline during that time| from more than 72 births per 1|000 females to just 41| which represents a 44 percent drop overall.“These historic declines are good news for babies| teens and Chicago|” said CDPH Commissioner Julie Morita| M.D. “By providing teens with resources| information and support they need| we can drive these numbers down even further| ensuring every teenager has a chance to be teenager.”  Becoming pregnant early in life can lead to challenges for birth parents and their children. Studies show that approximately 38 percent of teen mothers earn a high school diploma| and less than 2 percent earn a college degree by the age of 30. Children born to teen mothers are also 50 percent more likely to repeat a grade and are less likely to complete high school than children of older mothers.  "We know that delaying parenthood beyond the teen years helps keep young people in school|" said CPS Office of Student Health and Wellness Chief Health Officer Kenneth Fox| M.D. "The CPS comprehensive Sexual Health & Wellness curriculum is vital to those efforts. When teens reach important educational milestones like graduation| they benefit from increased opportunities for themselves and their families."   Despite this good news| disparities persist at both the local and national levels in the rates of teen births and other sexual health outcomes| like sexually transmitted infections. CDPH has launched a comprehensive effort to further reduce the teen birth rate and promote equity for youth sexual and reproductive health in Chicago. ,May 28| 2017

334,Mayor Emanuel Announces City Expansion of HIV Services Yields Historic 400 Percent Increase in Number of Individuals Served,Mayor Emanuel and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) today announced more than 3|600 people living with HIV in the city received vital services in the first year of new partnerships between CDPH| the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Howard Brown Health. This means four times as many individuals were served when compared to prior years. The new partnership was first laid out by Mayor Emanuel during his 2016 budget proposal| where he called for greater collaboration between CDPH and community providers to serve more residents living with HIV.  “This is an important milestone that demonstrates how our new partnerships are not only effective and efficient| but exceed our goal of individuals served|” Mayor Emanuel said. “We are treating more Chicagoans living with HIV than ever before| allowing them to live their best lives while reinvesting savings in other prevention and treatment efforts.” Following a competitive bidding process| UIC and Howard Brown Health assumed management of HIV Primary Care clinics in Englewood and Uptown| respectively| in March 2016.  Since first assuming management of the clinics| both organizations have increased services| outreach and education| while spending less. The savings from the new partnership have been reinvested into additional HIV treatment services| including oral health and case management services| in critical areas. “Chicago is working together to end the HIV epidemic|” said CDPH Commissioner Julie Morita. “This is a great example of the power of collaboration. We were able to quadruple the number of residents receiving services| helping more people living with HIV have access to the care they need to live long| healthy lives.” “Our Uptown clinic allows us to provide general care as well as specialized HIV care to patients right where they live|” said Dr. Robert Barish| vice chancellor for health affairs at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “Our mission is to provide healthcare to all by minimizing barriers to receiving care| including transportation| which is why we are so proud that this clinic has exceeded our expectations in terms of the number of people served in the Uptown area.” “Primary care ensures a better quality of life for people living with HIV and Howard Brown Health is proud to serve those who need it the most in Englewood|” said David Ernesto Munar| President and CEO of Howard Brown Health. “We are especially proud to exceed our service goals and look forward to continuing this work to ensure the residents of Englewood receive quality care.”  Primary care includes general check-ups but also help patients monitor their medication to reduce their viral load and ultimately reach viral suppression significantly reducing the risk of transmission. Treatment among individuals living with HIV is a key strategy in CDPH’s prevention model along with Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)| a daily pill that helps prevent HIV. In addition to HIV primary care services| each clinic offers early intervention services to ensure patients are quickly linked and retained in care| mental health and medical case management services. These partnerships are part of a comprehensive citywide plan to ensure those living with HIV receive the care they need and to reduce the number of new transmissions of HIV.  According to the 2016 HIV/STI Surveillance Report| 79 percent of Chicago residents newly diagnosed with HIV were linked to medical care| like what is offered at these clinics| within one month of diagnosis. Within 12 months of diagnosis| 90 percent of individuals had been linked to medical care| placing Chicago well ahead of national rates.  Over the last decade| Chicago has seen a steady overall decline in new HIV diagnoses however| in 2015 Englewood and Uptown had some of the highest HIV diagnoses rates and Uptown also has one of the highest rates of people living with HIV. CDPH maintains HIV primary care services in these areas to ensure that residents can access the quality care they need to keep themselves healthy and continues to use data to strategically increase accessibility to resources and care and promote health equity citywide.  “More people are living and thriving with HIV in Chicago than ever before|” added Commissioner Morita. “We will continue to invest available resources to provide quality care and ultimately bring this epidemic to an end.” For more information on the Primary Care clinics please visit www.cityofchicago.org/health.,May 20| 2017

336,Mayor Emanuel Announces Chicago Plan Commission Passage of Innovative Framework to Guide Future North Branch Development,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced the Chicago Plan Commission’s unanimous approval of the North Branch Industrial Corridor Framework. The plan is expected to generate billions of dollars in private community investment| hundreds of millions of dollars in new tax revenues| and tens of thousands of jobs benefitting the entire City of Chicago. The plan is designed to generate significant resources to support commercial projects and economic opportunities in neighborhoods that need investment.“This plan represents countless hours of community input and thoughtful planning designed to balance the needs of community members and local businesses while paving the way to a bright future for the north branch industrial corridor|” Mayor Emanuel said. “In addition to building a new future for the north branch area| this framework will also generate revenue from this thriving area to support industrial businesses throughout Chicago. Now we move forward to the next step in the process| which will bring together the north branch stakeholders to turn this plan into concrete progress for the community.”Through a public engagement process that began in the spring of 2016 and included more than 800 participants and 18 community meetings| the North Branch Framework identifies new land use parameters| transportation improvements and open space amenities for 760 acres of land along the Chicago River between Kinzie Street and Fullerton Avenue. With goals to maintain the North Branch as an important economic engine and vital job center; provide better access for all transportation modes; and build upon the corridor’s unique natural and built environment| the Framework’s 19 specific planning recommendations could eventually triple the local employment base| create more than 60 acres of public open space| and bring more than a dozen multi-modal transportation enhancements to an area that hadn’t been formally reviewed for comprehensive land use improvements in nearly three decades.As the first phase of Mayor Emanuel’s Industrial Corridor Modernization Initiative that will expand to the city’s 25 other designated industrial corridors in coming months| the Framework’s adoption by Plan Commission will serve as a guide to assess future development projects and infrastructure improvements within corridor boundaries. Specific zoning and related implementation goals involving the plan and future development projects will require additional Plan Commission and City Council approval.“The community engagement for the Framework identified often competing needs that the plan successfully balances on behalf of the area and the entire city|” Department of Planning and Development Commissioner David L. Reifman said. “The Framework takes a sustainable approach to all the input we received| from zoning to traffic to open space.”Historically the home of heavy manufacturing and related uses| the North Branch corridor currently supports approximately 15|000 jobs| including thousands of business services| technology| and business management positions that have exponentially increased since 2002. Over the same period| the corridor’s manufacturing workforce simultaneously decreased by 40 percent to 1|500 jobs| resulting in several large tracts of vacant land within the corridor."The redevelopment plan will support job growth| infrastructure investment| economic development and new revenue|” Theresa E. Mintle| President & CEO of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce said. “It's a win-win for the community| business and the City|" “This plan will leverage a historic modernization of one part of Chicago and make it benefit the entire city|” Ald. Walter Burnett said. “I look forward to seeing the new affordable housing and job opportunities that will be part of this revitalization.”“This framework is the culmination of an inclusive| transparent process fueled by the interests of impacted residents| community stakeholders and the City’s planning experts|” Ald. Brian Hopkins said. “I’m committed to delivering on the framework’s recommendations that include existing infrastructure upgrades| additional transit options| and opportunities to add significant recreational open space| which will ultimately yield lasting benefits for the community.”The Framework’s land use recommendations respond to market demands for a dynamic mix of uses| along with appropriate transportation and open space enhancements that support its viability for future businesses| workers| residents and visitors.“When implemented| the framework could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new public and private corridor investments that would generate tens of thousands of construction| manufacturing| retail and service sector jobs|” Jorge Ramirez| President of Chicago Federation of Labor said. “These are working families that will use their hard-earned money to spend and invest in the communities in which they live.”The Framework also includes implementation strategies that will fund local and citywide improvements| as well as design guidelines that will help maintain the corridor’s uniquely urban character.Major planning principles include:LAND USE•    Target more than 50 percent of corridor land for employment purposes•    Allow new mixed-use development at appropriate locations with provisions for affordable housing and publicly accessible open space•    Increase allowable density and height while creating high-quality publicly accessible open spaces and non-vehicular transportation improvements•    Encourage new uses at the bases of buildings along the river to encourage public activitiesTRANSPORTATION•    Reconfigure roadways| viaducts| and bridge reconstruction projects to help manage traffic circulation•    Build a dozen new pedestrian/bike bridges and under-bridge connections along the river to increase the effectiveness of the area’s five transit stations•    Extend the 606 multi-purpose path over the river•    Leverage technologies like “smart signals” and real-time displays to minimize peak travel times•    Study a dedicated public transit-way on existing rail corridors and other rights-of-wayOPEN SPACE•    Build 32 acres of linear park space as part of a new| seven-mile river trail| consistent with Mayor Emanuel’s vision of enhancing the river as Chicago’s next recreational frontier•    Incorporate at least 10 acres of new publicly accessible open spaces for sports and recreational fields•    Add a one-acre park as part of a 606 connection with the river trail•    Create 17 acres of wetland parksIMPLEMENTATIONAs adopted by Plan Commission| the Framework will be used by the City Council to consider initial zoning changes that accommodate necessary land use transitions in the North Branch area. The City Council will also consider Planned Developments (PD) and other zoning changes proposed by private developers and property owners. Initial zoning recommendations seek to:•    Change existing Planned Manufacturing District (PMD) zoning in the north portion of the corridor to Manufacturing (M)| which would permit existing uses and accommodate transitions to mixed-use office| commercial and residential uses at appropriate locations.•    Maintain and refine existing Planned Manufacturing District (PMD) zoning in the central portion of the corridor| largely around Goose Island.•    Change existing Planned Manufacturing District (PMD) zoning in the southern portion of the corridor to Downtown Service (DS)| which would permit existing uses and accommodate transitions to downtown-type mixed-use commercial and residential uses nearby. •    Establish an overlay district and other land use parameters that identify buffer areas| use restrictions| and density regulations to ensure new development projects enhance the corridor’s overall development patterns and function.FUNDING APPROACHThe plan recommends several new and existing funding tools to finance proposed improvements within the corridor as well as other parts of the city:•    A new Industrial Corridor System Fee would apply to projects in the North Branch and other corridors that are transitioning from PMD/manufacturing to other uses| triggered by private applications for a zoning change away from industrial zoning. Similar to the way Mayor Emanuel has successfully leveraged resources with the new Neighborhood Opportunity Fund| redevelopment within the North Branch could generate tens of millions of new revenues to support industrial improvement projects in other industrial corridors throughout the city.•    Application of the existing downtown Zoning Bonus system for the southern portion of the corridor| available through a change to Downtown (DX) mixed-use zoning| will result in tens of millions of additional dollars for the Mayor’s Neighborhood Opportunity Fund| to invest in commercial development on the city’s South and West Sides.•    A new Zoning Bonus system in the northern portion of the corridor would enable new projects to seek increased density through a voluntary payment. The payment would primarily support local improvements within the North Branch area| as well as contribute to vital projects in industrial corridors throughout other parts of the city.•    Planned Development (PD) contributions that would provide or contribute to publicly accessible open space| river walks| traffic signals| roads| and other infrastructure costs.•    Other city| state and federal sources.A complete copy of the plan and more information about Mayor Emanuel’s Industrial Corridor Modernization Initiative are available at the DPD web site at www.cityofchicago.org/dpd.,May 18| 2017

339,Mayor Emanuel Joins Illinois Municipal Leaders Urging Governor and State Lawmakers to Pass a Budget Without Shifting Burden to Local Taxpayers,CHICAGO – Mayor Rahm Emanuel today joined a bipartisan group of local leaders from across the greater Chicagoland area in urging Governor Rauner and state lawmakers to pass a budget without putting the burden on local governments by reducing the local share of the Local Government Distributive Fund (LGDF).  “Too often the budget debate in Springfield is viewed as something abstract| or a partisan battle of attrition|” Mayor Emanuel said. “As leaders at the local level who must address problems despite the state’s funding shortfalls and bill backlogs| we know full well this is neither an abstraction nor an opportunity for partisan gain – it’s a matter of doing the right thing for people all across Illinois. Local governments throughout the state already are stretched to the brink| and cannot afford careless cuts to the LGDF.” Local governments receive a portion of state income taxes| which is distributed through the LGDF. Reducing the local share of LGDF would result in far fewer resources available to provide public safety| economic development| transportation and housing for residents in towns| cities and villages across the greater Chicago region.  “The Mayors Caucus sees the state’s finances at a critical point and action is needed now to keep us from irreparable damage|” said Robert Nunamaker| President of Village of Fox River Grove and Chairman of the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus.View the letter signed by local leaders representing 275 cities| towns| and other municipalities across the greater Chicagoland area.,May 17| 2017

This project is made possible by a generous gift from Kenneth Griffin.“This is an important next step in continued efforts to make the Lakefront Trail safer and more accessible for the thousands of cyclists| runners and walkers that use the path each day|” Mayor Emanuel said. “Trail separation does more than address issues of overcrowding; it builds a better future for one of the city’s greatest assets by ensuring Chicagoans and visitors are able to experience what the lakefront has to offer.”The Lakefront Trail Separation was designed to alleviate areas of congestion by creating two distinct paths; a bike trail and a separate pedestrian trail for those on foot. Mayor Emanuel originally announced plans to separate the trail from Fullerton to Ohio streets and 31st to 51st streets when he unveiled Building on Burnham| a comprehensive vision to invest in Chicago's parks and open spaces.“I am excited to see us taking another step forward towards making the Lakefront trail safer and more enjoyable for everyone in Chicago|” said Kenneth Griffin. “I appreciate all of the efforts that have gone into this great project and applaud Mayor Emanuel and Superintendent Kelly for their continued leadership.”Once complete| the split trail will provide separate paths for cyclists and pedestrians along the entire 18-mile pathway. The commuter trail| made of asphalt| will measure 12 feet in width and will be located closest to Lake Shore Drive. The pedestrian trail will measure 20 feet in width with 14 feet of asphalt and 6 feet of soft surface mix on either side."We have worked collectively with the City of Chicago| Active Transportation Alliance and Chicago Area Runners Association for years in search of ways to enhance the lakefront trail experience|" said General Superintendent and CEO Michael P.

The service model concentrates sanitation workers in targeted areas of the city each day and creates balanced service regions to improve daily collection performance. The initial roll out of the system began in 2012 and allowed DSS to reduce its average daily deployment by more than 40 garbage trucks. “I appreciate this opportunity that Mayor Emanuel has given me. It is a task I do not take lightly| but with my background in engineering and construction and over 20 years of operational knowledge in the private and public sectors| we will be able to complete the Mayor’s goal of Building a New Chicago.”Conner will be charged with overseeing Mayor Emanuel’s Building a New Chicago program at DWM| which| to date| has replaced 470 miles of water main| 102 miles of sewer main and has relined 271 miles of existing sewer.

The results build on Chicago’s record performance in 2016| when 54.1 million people visited Chicago. The results also bring the city even closer to reaching the Mayor's goal of 55 million visitors annually by 2020."Tourism creates jobs that reach every part of the city of Chicago|” Mayor Emanuel said. "We had a record-breaking year in 2016| and this year is off to a record-breaking start. This progress will ensure that we continue to create economic opportunities across Chicago and grow even closer to my goal of 55 million visitors by 2020.”In the first quarter of 2017| total rooms occupied reached a record 2.12 million| an increase of 5.9 percent. The occupancy rate increased by 2.6 percent to 58 percent| and leisure room demand achieved a record 1.52 million rooms occupied in the quarter| a gain of 4.4 percent. Fourteen out of the last 15 months have now seen leisure room demand growth. Group room demand grew 10 percent| which was driven by nine major meetings convening in Chicago in the first quarter| filling more than 550|000 rooms. “We are thrilled to see the momentum generated last year continue through the first quarter|" Whitaker said. "Chicago continues to excel as a major meetings destination and the growth in leisure demand signals our continued success and reputation as a destination that features amazing vacation and lifestyle experiences."Chicago welcomed a record 52.55 million domestic visitors and an estimated 1.56 million overseas visitors in 2016. In that year| Chicago's tourism industry supported an estimated 145|137 jobs (3.3 percent increase) and $15 billion in direct tourism spending (2.6 percent increase).

350,Mayor Emanuel Announces Major Increase in Wheelchair-Accessible Transit Options for Residents and Visitors Throughout Chicago,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced a major increase in the availability of wheelchair-accessible transit options for Chicago residents and visitors. Since the Mayor took office| the city has tripled the number Wheelchair Accessible Vehicles (WAVs) from 91 to 298| with 130 WAV taxicabs added since January 1| 2016. This progress keeps the city on track to reach the Emanuel Administration’s goal of 400 wheelchair-accessible taxicabs in 2018.  To keep the progress going| the Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP) has approved plans from Uber| Lyft and VIA to enhance service to customers with disabilities. Under the plans| the transportation network providers (TNPs| also known as rideshares) will bring an additional 50 wheelchair-accessible vehicles online and available to Chicago’s residents and visitors within the next six months.“Every Chicagoan deserves access to safe| reliable transit|” Mayor Emanuel said. “Major innovations are taking place in the public passenger vehicle and transportation network provider industries| and the city of Chicago recognizes the hard work of industry| advocates and aldermen to make this a reality.”The City’s Accessibility Fund| which is supported by fees paid by the taxi and TNP industries| has driven much of the progress seen to date. In 2012| the city of Chicago began offering a $15|000-$20|000 incentive to convert a vehicle to a WAV taxicab or purchase a factory-built WAV taxicab to increase the number of wheelchair-accessible taxicabs in Chicago. In 2016| the city of Chicago created new incentives| including: (1) an elimination of a fee charged to Wheelchair-Accessible Vehicle (WAV) medallion holders for dispatch service| (2) a $10|000 “early bird” incentive to medallion owners that purchased WAV taxicabs in 2016| and (3) up to $5|000 in an annual grant for WAV taxicab owners for vehicle maintenance| among others.Due to reforms enacted as part of Mayor Emanuel’s 2016 budget| the City’s Accessibility Fund receives approximately $6.5 million annually to fully support the Administration’s accessibility goals. In 2017 alone| BACP has already disbursed more than $1.5 million year-to-date in these funds to support an increase in wheelchair-accessible vehicle options. This has supported 45 WAV taxicab conversions| the purchase of 18 new factory-built WAV taxicabs| 50 “early bird” incentives for WAV taxicabs purchased in 2016| and maintenance on 37 WAV taxicabs. Since Mayor Emanuel took office| the number of WAV taxicabs operating in Chicago has increased from 91 to 298| more than tripling the total number in the city’s fleet.In June 2016| Chicago City Council passed reforms that required TNPs to submit plans to enhance service to customers with disabilities. In January 2017| Uber| Lyft and VIA submitted their plans for review| which have now been approved by BACP in consultation with MOPD. The companies now have six months to implement them. The city will re-evaluate the plans on an ongoing basis to ensure that customer demand is met going forward.Using these companies’ apps| residents will soon be able to secure rides from additional wheelchair-accessible vehicles that will be brought online and more efficiently connect to the city’s nearly 300 existing available WAV taxicabs. The addition of 50 wheelchair-accessible vehicles over the next six months by the TNP industry mirrors the rate at which WAV taxicabs were being added to the city’s fleet as of early 2017.“The Mayor’s hard work to increase the number of wheelchair accessible options is paying off|” BACP Commissioner Samantha Fields said. “The City of Chicago will always remain committed to working with industry to ensure robust service to members of the disability community.”“Chicago is leading the way to create more accessible transportation options for people with disabilities|” MOPD Commissioner Karen Tamley said. “The disability community will soon be able to rely on both taxis and rideshare companies for wheelchair-accessible transportation service.”In 2016| Mayor Emanuel and the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP) announced that Open Doors Organization had been selected after a competitive bidding process to provide centralized wheelchair-accessible taxicab dispatch service to passengers across Chicago. The move further improves services for people with disabilities and increases safe and reliable transportation options for people who use wheelchairs. In 2017| nearly 29|000 trips have been taken through Open Doors year-to-date. More than 63|000 trips were taken through Open Doors in 2016| up from over 34|000 trips provided in 2015. Recent data from taxis and rideshare companies showed that trips throughout Chicago reached record highs in 2016.In 2016 the total number of trips from the taxi and TNP industries was approximately 77.5 million. This amounts to a 287 percent increase over 2013| when the total number of trips was approximately 27 million.In November 2015| the City of Chicago authorized licensed TNP pick-ups at the airports. This resulted in more choice for consumers and more trips provided. In 2016 alone| approximately 8.6 million airport trips were provided by the taxi and rideshare industries combined compared to approximately 6.3 million in 2015.Additionally| over the past several years| Chicago has witnessed significant change in the ground transportation industry. More than 80 percent of taxis are now alternative fuel or fuel-efficient vehicles| the number of wheelchair-accessible taxis has more than doubled since 2011| and residents have access to universal taxi app service. BACP oversees the licensing of Chicago’s public chauffeurs and public vehicles including TNPs| taxicabs| liveries| charter and site seeing buses| horse drawn carriages| ambulances| water taxis and tour boats. The department also oversees the purchasing of taxicab medallions| vehicle inspections and rates of fare. Learn more about BACP’s at www.cityofchicago.org/BACP.,May 8| 2017
351,Mayor Emanuel Announces EPA Climate Change Information Now on City Website,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced the creation of a City of Chicago “Climate Change is Real” website| putting information from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Climate Change Website on the City of Chicago’s servers after the Trump administration unceremoniously removed it from the federal government’s websites on April 29. The new site| www.cityofchicago.org/climatechangeisreal| ensures the public has ready access to information the EPA has developed over decades of research to inform the public about the impact of climate change. Mayor Emanuel is calling on other U.S. Mayors to follow suit. “The Trump administration can attempt to erase decades of work from scientists and federal employees on the reality of climate change| but burying your head in the sand doesn’t erase the problem|” Mayor Emanuel said.  “We are going to ensure Chicago’s residents remain well informed about the effects of climate change| and I encourage cities| academic institutions| and others to voice concerns to follow suit to ensure this important information does not disappear.”The new website includes information on the basic science behind climate change| the different ways in which weather is impacted from increased greenhouse had emissions| and actions the federal government has taken to reduce the impact.  “Cities are becoming central in the climate fight. In the absence of federal leadership| this is a key moment for local action|” Henry Henderson| Midwest Director for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)| said. “Chicago has long been a clean energy leader and is now stepping up to help defend the nation against the seeming war on climate science underway in DC.” The Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT) has released a new tool so that the City and the public as a whole can easily save| archive and preserve open data from public data portals| such as the EPA site.“We will not allow this data to simply be taken away from us|” Chief Data Officer Tom Schenk| Jr. said. “We will create and share the tools so we can continue to understand the risks climate change has for us and to combat it together.” Today’s announcement builds on Mayor Emanuel’s strong environmental track record since 2011. In January| Mayor Emanuel announced that Chicago has reduced its carbon emissions by seven percent from 2010 to 2015 all while the region’s economy grew 12 percent. The emissions reduction| equivalent to shutting down a coal power plant for eight months| compares to a one percent increase in nationwide emissions from 2009 to 2014. On April 9| the Mayor announced that by 2025 all of Chicago’s public buildings will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. That transition means that 8 percent of the city-wide electricity load or 1.8 billion kilowatt hours will come from clean and renewable sources. This follows the 2013 commitment that the City made to eliminating coal from its electricity supply.   On April 26| the City of Chicago was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2017 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award. The award is given annually to honor organizations that have made outstanding contributions to protecting the environment through energy efficiency and recognized the Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenge and its 76 member buildings covering 51.3 million square feet-all of which have committed to reducing their energy use by 20 percent. The award also recognized the four years of successful implementation of the City’s Energy Benchmarking Ordinance which has reduced energy use by 4 percent in buildings covered by the ordinance. In March| the Mayor announced that the Smart Lighting Project will start on the South and West Sides this summer. Once approved by City Council| the Chicago Smart Lighting Project will replace 270|000 of Chicago’s light fixtures and add a management system that will give the city a state-of-the-art smart lighting grid. Under Mayor Emanuel’s leadership| Chicago’s reduction in waste has a played a significant role in improving the City’s environment.  From 2010 to 2015 Chicago’s carbon emissions from waste were down 30 percent| with the expansion of the City’s recycling program playing a significant factor.  During those give years the City increased the numbers of tons of recycled material from 58|000 to 97|000. And just last week the Mayor announced that since implementation of the City’s check-out bag tax in February| residents have reduced their plastic bag use by 40 percent. The Mayor’s leadership on issues of climate change and sustainability is clear and Chicago will continue to take action.,May 7| 2017

The case will be heard by a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on May 15.On Wednesday| April 19| a total of 31 cities and counties filed an amicus brief in support of the Maryland district court’s decision enjoining a provision of the President’s Executive Order on travel by individuals from certain Muslim-majority countries. The case will be heard en banc by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals on May 8 before all 15 judges.“Once again| New York City stands firmly against the White House’s exclusionary policies|” said New York City Mayor de Blasio. “Immigrants are an essential part of our city – from the local economy to civic and cultural life. Not only is this policy discriminatory| it makes us all less safe by undermining trust with law enforcement and making immigrants more vulnerable to victimization. By targeting individuals from Muslim-majority nations| this order is also a refutation of our nation’s historic commitment to be a home of refuge for those fleeing violence. New York| in partnership with cities across America| will keep fighting misguided and dangerous policies that are an affront to our morals.”“Philadelphia is again proud to voice its opposition to this discriminatory travel ban| which goes against the fundamentals of our Constitution and promotes fear among our immigrant populations|” said Philadelphia Mayor Kenney. “Along with our fellow cities and counties| we will take every opportunity to make our voices heard in this fight.”“We know immigrants and their families play a vital role in our economy| culture and overall identity| and this travel ban goes against the very bedrock of our nation|" said Boston Mayor Walsh. "The United States is rooted in the freedom to practice one's faith| and I am proud to stand with my fellow mayors as we continue to welcome people from all countries| regardless of their religion." Chicago| New York City| Los Angeles| Philadelphia and Boston| joined by Austin| Carrboro| Central Falls (RI)| Chapel Hill| Cook County| Gary| Iowa City| Ithaca| Jersey City| Madison| Minneapolis| Montgomery County (MD)| Oakland| Portland| Providence| St. Louis| St. Paul| San Francisco| Santa Clara County| Santa Monica| Seattle| Skokie| South Bend and West Hollywood| presented the local government position to the two federal courts. Both briefs explain the vital contribution that immigrants make to our cities and country| points out that classifications based on religion and natural origin are presumptively invalid| and argues that the travel ban is misguided and unconstitutional. Further| the briefs argue that cities and counties serve as gateways for immigrants and refugees starting new lives in America| and that the President’s executive order endangers communities; undermines national security; limits the labor pool; decreases tax revenues; dampens tourism industries; and harms businesses| educational institutions and hospitals. The City and County of Honolulu also joined the brief in the Ninth Circuit.Earlier this year| President Trump issued an executive order| followed by a revised executive order| restricting immigration by prohibiting people from six countries—Iran| Libya| Somalia| Sudan| Syria and Yemen—from entering the U.S. for 90 days and halting the admission into the United States of people granted refugee status for 120 days.Today’s filing in the Ninth Circuit is the fourth time Chicago| New York| Los Angeles| Philadelphia| Boston and other cities and counties have taken legal action against President Trump’s attempts to restrict travel into the United States. The court is reviewing a decision by the district court in Hawaii that relied on Chicago’s brief.The City’s brief was prepared with the pro bono assistance of several attorneys of the law firm Riley Safer Holmes & Cancila LLP| which has offices in Chicago| New York and San Francisco.  “The City is grateful for Riley Safer’s contribution to our efforts to protect the rights of immigrants and refugees and to defend Chicago’s status as a city that embraces diversity and promotes inclusion|” said Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel.The recent legal action is one of several actions the Emanuel Administration has taken since the November election to reiterate Chicago’s status as a welcoming City.Among these| to provide legal assistance to vulnerable Chicago residents| the city created a Legal Protection Fund| pledging $1.3 million to the fund to integrate legal support from attorneys with community navigators rooted in Chicago's many ethnic communities to provide outreach| education and assistance to immigrant families across Chicago.On December 7| Mayor Emanuel presented a letter to President-elect Donald Trump urging him to continue the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program until Congress modernizes the immigration system and provides a more permanent form of relief for the over one million young people who were brought to the U.S. before they were 16 and are eligible for the program.Mayor Emanuel| U.S. Senator Dick Durbin and Congressman Luis Gutierrez also launched a new “Chicago is With You” task force that is collaborating on mental health| legal services| employer communications| and education policies to ensure the City is delivering comprehensive services to immigrants| refugees and other disenfranchised communities.Since taking office| Mayor Emanuel has launched a series of initiatives that improve the immigrant community’s access to services| expand new and existing immigrant businesses| and welcome and celebrate Chicago’s diverse immigrant communities. These initiatives include launching the Cities for Citizenship Campaign with the Mayors of New York City and Los Angeles| which has grown into a bipartisan effort which works with 30 city and county leaders across America.,April 21| 2017

Much of the station’s appearance has been restored over the years while retaining its historical character. This includes the ticket agent’s booth| which was faithfully replicated in the 1980s based on original 1897 plans and is still in use today. The $18.2 million project is the largest renovation in nearly 30 years for Quincy| which was built in 1897 and is one of CTA’s oldest rail stations.  Last renovated in 1988| Quincy station serves more than 2.2 million riders annually via the Brown| Orange| Pink and Purple lines and is a major transfer point for 10 CTA bus routes| Union Station and the LaSalle Street Metra Station. The project is the latest in a series of transit investments by Mayor Emanuel to improve transit in the downtown Loop| including:•    Washington/Wabash| $75M| opens Summer 2017•    Union Station Transit Center| $43M| opened 2016•    Loop Link| $32M| opened 2015•    Harrison Station Renovation| $10M| completed in 2014•    Loop Track Renewal| $53M| completed in 2013 The project is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

The second phase will include placement of the eligible families into 100 new permanent supportive housing units to be added by the Chicago Low Income Housing Trust Fund.“We are thrilled that the city is committing a new resource for housing for homeless families|” said Doug Schenkelberg| Executive Director of Chicago Coalition for the Homeless| “and in particular that they are recognizing the needs of the highly vulnerable doubled-up households that have not been able to receive housing and services previously.” Because families that are homeless are at a significantly higher risk for experiencing violence| the City and the Coalition will focus on communities experiencing some of the city’s highest rates of violence| including: Austin| Humboldt Park| West Englewood| and Englewood. Together| the City and the Coalition will identify families by working closely with shelters specializing in family services| and with Chicago Public Schools (CPS) to assess families of schools with a higher concentration of homeless students to select them for housing. “The goal of this initiative is to help our most vulnerable families to establish stability so that their children can succeed|” said DFSS Commissioner Lisa Morrison Butler. "Thanks to collaboration with our partners at the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless| the city will deliver a coordinated response to ensure the needs of our most vulnerable families are met| and to prevent families on the cusp from experiencing homelessness.”  The initiative will enlist feedback from designated shelters in the key community areas| placing priority on families with students attending schools in the area. These schools include: Ellington ES| Nicholson ES| Earle ES| Ward ES| Howe ES| and Lowell ES.  Once families are identified for the program| they will receive housing vouchers| and will be matched to a housing provider who will help them locate housing and ensure a smooth transition. Families will continue to work with these providers as they receive wraparound services to support them in maintaining permanent housing. Families will also receive support by housing navigators in getting to appointments and obtaining required documents for housing applications.  The matching and transition process will be led by CSH using best practices based on implementation of the city's emerging coordinated entry system for homeless service and housing| a vital ingredient to the success of similar initiatives focusing on housing Veterans and Chronically homeless residents. The Housing Homeless Families initiative was borne out of a yearlong planning process led by the City and with input by the Coalition| and draws upon lessons derived through the Ending Veterans Homeless Initiative and the Chronic Homeless Pilot programs| which use the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) to leverage “real-time” data to identify where the most vulnerable families are| and to allocate resources for families and individuals experiencing homelessness based on where the immediate needs are. The initiative will be funded in part by a $1 million investment by the Chicago Low Income Housing Trust Fund (CLIHF)| with matched funds via the City’s house sharing revenue stream. Last year| the Chicago City Council enacted an unprecedented four percent surcharge on the house sharing industry| making Chicago among the first municipalities to leverage a dedicated funding source for homelessness.  To date| the city has allocated more than $500|000 in funding for homelessness reduction| serving approximately 150 homeless individuals. Since taking office| Mayor Emanuel has made addressing homelessness a key priority. In addition to a 5-year commitment to create more affordable housing| the Emanuel Administration has launched several innovative programs with a focus on reducing homelessness| including: participation in the national EVHI campaign helping to house more than 3|000 homeless Veterans to date; creation of a new day labor program to employ and offer services to more than 500 panhandlers; and a significant expansion of affordable housing which has created or preserved more than 38|000 affordable units since 2011.,April 20| 2017

375,Mayor Emanuel Launches New Open Data Portal,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today launched a new| redesigned open data portal to help residents better navigate City information and use it in everyday life. For example| sidewalk café permits will now be available on the portal| creating a one-stop resource for outdoor dining locations in the City. “We are making open city government data more accessible so everyone can learn more about where they live and work|” Mayor Emanuel said. “The new data portal will help residents and visitors in ways big and small| like allowing them to discover outdoor restaurant options through better access to sidewalk café permits. This is another example of our continued efforts to make data available| but also relevant to Chicagoans in unique ways.” In addition to searching all businesses licensing data already available| patrons can now see a dataset of restaurants and bars with sidewalk café permits. To date| there are more than 500 sidewalk café permits within the City. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis| with new permits added daily as they are approved. The open data portal promotes transparency by making raw City data available to the public. It contains over 600 data sets and receives more than 80|000 visits per month| with nearly one million visits in 2016. The redesigned website makes it easier for all Chicagoans to find facts| maps| and data about Chicago| such as restaurant inspections| business licenses| and taxi trips. The updated data portal has several new features| including a new home page that highlights relevant information and apps| redesigned data pages that provide context for each dataset| updated exploration tools that allow you to create charts and maps more easily| and video tutorials. Mobile device users will also be able to seamlessly use the redesigned portal on smartphones and tablets. Thirty percent of open data portal visitors are using mobile devices| with that number expected to rise. Research conducted by the Arizona State University and University of Iowa in conjunction with the City of Chicago has shown Chicagoans in low-income areas without home broadband connectivity are more likely to use mobile devices to access city services| such as the data portal| underscoring the importance of mobile accessibility. The redesigned open data portal was released as a beta in September 2016 to get feedback from residents. The City partnered with Smart Chicago Collaborative to host a user-feedback session at Woodson Regional Library. The City also hosted feedback sessions with software developers and user experience experts to elicit feedback from a broad audience. Numerous adjustments were made based on feedback from residents and will continue to optimize the experience for all. “Chicago was one of the earliest adopters of open data portals| and is an important part of Chicago’s strategy to be a smarter city|” Chief Data Officer Tom Schenk said. “City of Chicago staff have also leveraged data from the data portal to make better| more informed decisions.” Chicago’s investment in open data through strategic partnerships with civic tech volunteers and startups| has also helped improve city services. By making more and more data accessible| the City has facilitated the development of numerous innovative civic applications by independent developers| such as: • Chicago Works| which allows residents to make service requests to 311 and track issues as they are addressed.• Wasmycartowed.com| which lets users look up their car by license plate| make| or model and find out if it has been towed or relocated.• Mind My Business| which is an iOS and Android app that provides alerts to small business on construction| traffic| 311| inspections| and other data so they can make more informed decisions to save money and create opportunities.• SweepAround.us| which allows users to input their address and register for text or e-mail alerts for a reminder when their street will be swept so they can move their vehicle. Chicago’s open data portal has also provided a platform to build the city’s data-driven approach to improving operations. In 2015| Chicago launched a predictive food inspection process using data from the open data portal. The model helps the City of Chicago’s health inspectors prioritize their annual inspections of nearly 16|000 food establishments to ensure food safety. Leveraging the data updated daily on the portal| the predictive analytics model has increased the efficiency of city health inspectors by 25 percent| and landed the city a Top 25 Bright Idea award from Harvard University for innovation in government.

One of the largest voluntary energy efficiency programs in the country| the program now boasts 76 buildings and 51.3 million square feet participating. “From Rogers Park to Trumbull Park big buildings around the City are showing they can work together to reduce emissions| save money and put people to work|” Mayor Emanuel said. “The 76 buildings participating send a clear signal around the country| especially Washington| that Chicago will continue to lead the way in sustainability.” The new participants include six affordable housing properties owned by the Chicago Housing Authority and one new house of worship| reflecting the widening scope of the program. One-half the Challenge’s new participants| and over one-quarter of participants in total| sit outside the Central Business District. Through 2015| Chicago Energy Challenge participants have saved 90 million kilowatt-hours per year| representing 70|000 metric tons in avoided greenhouse gas emissions - equivalent to removing 14|000 cars from the road. “We are proud to partner with Retrofit Chicago to bring energy efficiency best practices to buildings throughout all of Chicago’s neighborhoods|” said Katie Kaluzny| Associate Director of the U.S. Green Building Council – Illinois Chapter. “We look forward to continued partnerships with Mayor Emanuel| the Chicago Housing Authority and others within the challenge to provide volunteer mentors and educational programming to help everyone reach their energy efficiency goals in the coming years.” The efforts of the Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenged have been bolstered by The Chicago Energy Benchmarking ordinance| which increases awareness and transparency of energy use in large buildings. Together| these properties have achieved estimated energy savings of $17.6 million per year. The next compliance period ends on June 1| 2017. “MB Real Estate is a proud supporter of Mayor Emanuel’s Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenge|” said Suzanne Hendrick| Senior Vice President and Director of Asset Management for MB Real Estate. “We have seven properties participating in the Energy Challenge with 333 North Michigan and 30 West Monroe recently reaching the 20% energy savings milestone. One North LaSalle| 55 West Wacker| and The Chicago Bar Association have recently committed to The Challenge and look forward to a successful 2017. In keeping with the Mayor’s goal of making Chicago the most affordable| competitive and sustainable city of the 21st century| we strive to have all qualified buildings join the Challenge and continue to promote energy efficiency.” On Sunday| Mayor Emanuel announced the City| addition to Chicago Public Schools| Chicago Park District| Chicago Housing Authority| and City Colleges of Chicago were committing to move their buildings’ electricity use to 100 percent renewable energy by 2025. When implemented| Chicago will be the largest major city in the country to have a 100 percent renewable energy supply for its public buildings. Last week| the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced the City of Chicago earned a 2017 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award. It is given annually to honor organizations that have made outstanding contributions to protecting the environment through energy efficiency. And last month the Mayor announced that the Smart Lighting Project will start on the South and West Sides this summer.,April 14| 2017

380,Mayor Emanuel Reaffirms City of Chicago's Ban on Travel to North Carolina Due to Discriminatory Law,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today reaffirmed the City of Chicago’s commitment to preventing discrimination against any and all groups by announcing that a policy barring travel to North Carolina will remain intact| despite recent action by the state to amend its bathroom policy. Just over a year ago| Mayor Emanuel issued the original ban on non-essential travel to North Carolina to renounce the discriminatory impact that the state’s bathroom policy placed against transgender individuals. While the state recently adapted the original bill barring transgender individuals from using the bathrooms consistent with how they identify| this measure does not go far enough in protecting the rights of the broader LGBTQ community. As a result| a new resolution will be brought forth at the monthly City Council meeting next week to affirm that the current restriction on travel to North Carolina for city business remains in place. “As a welcoming city for all| we are clear on our values of tolerance and inclusion| and we won’t stand by idly when discriminatory policies threaten the rights of any single group or community|” said Mayor Emanuel. “Until North Carolina acknowledges the rights of the LGBTQ community and treats all individuals fairly| the City of Chicago will be taking our business elsewhere| and we encourage others to do the same.” Mayor Emanuel doubled down on the City’s original 2016 ban of non-essential travel to North Carolina because the state's recent actions to amend its bathroom policy do not explicitly account for the rights of the broader LGBTQ community. Specifically| recent measures prevent local governments and municipalities in the state from passing their own local anti-discrimination laws and replace HB2's discriminatory| anti-transgender bathroom regulations with new regulations that continue to make it difficult for transgender people to access restrooms consistent with their gender identity.  “Today’s pledge by Mayor Emanuel to uphold the travel ban to North Carolina demonstrates that Chicago remains committed to protecting all groups from discrimination|” said Mona Noriega| Chair and Commissioner of the Commission on Human Relations. “We have made so much progress toward improving inclusion of LGBTQ individuals in recent years| and this action makes clear that Chicago stands up for the rights of all individuals and against discrimination in any form.” Last year| the administration took swift action in response to the passage of a North Carolina law which prohibited local governments from passing laws to protect members of the LGBTQ community| directing City department heads to restrict any City-funded or other travel by an employee representing the City of Chicago to the State of North Carolina. Since then| Chicago has ceased authorizing new travel to the state in conducting city business| except for in rare instances of contractual agreements and those required to enforce Chicago law. “Today’s commitment by Mayor Emanuel shows that Chicago will not tolerate discrimination|” said 44th Ward Alderman and LGBT Caucus chair| Tom Tunney. “While it’s unfortunate that discriminatory practices are being upheld by the State of North Carolina| the City Council stands with people regardless of sexuality or gender identity| and is steadfastly committed to ensuring Chicago remains a haven for all people.” This is just the latest action taken by the Mayor to combat discrimination against LGBTQ and transgender individuals. Since 2011| a series of policies have been implemented to secure the overall inclusion and rights of the LGBTQ community and to prevent discrimination throughout the city of Chicago. These include the city’s own bathroom protection policy and landmark transgender health care reforms.,April 13| 2017

Beginning this spring| CME Group will select 25 students to receive scholarships that will support them in furthering their college career with a bachelor’s degree in math| computer science| finance or economics at one of the City’s 15 Star Partner universities this fall. “Today| in the City of Chicago| high school graduation is no longer the last stop on a student’s educational journey|” said Mayor Emanuel. “I want to thank CME Group for their continued commitment to ensure that more of Chicago’s hard working students| regardless of financial means| can access college degrees and the career opportunities that come with it.” To ensure more students from all economic backgrounds can access a viable pathway to college| Mayor Emanuel created the Star Scholarship in 2014 to reward hard-working Chicago Public Schools (CPS) graduates with an opportunity to pursue a degree or certificate at City Colleges at no cost. Since that time| the program has grown to include partnerships with 15 Chicagoland colleges and universities to enable Star Scholars to continue their college education at a four-year university. CME Group joins the movement to ensure Star Scholars can continue with four-year opportunities this spring by providing 25 two-year scholarships valued at $5|000. This transfer scholarship opportunity is available to Chicago STAR Scholar graduates planning to continue their studies at one of the 15 Chicago Star Partnership colleges or universities to earn a four-year degree in a STEM-related pathway| which are in high demand by employers today. “We are proud to support the Mayor’s Chicago Star Scholarship and the opportunities it provides for our city’s hardworking and high-achieving CPS graduates|” said CME Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Duffy. “The program is testament to the strength of not only our city’s schools| but our talented students—and investing to enable them to continue their education today will only increase the vitality of our future business community tomorrow.” Working with CCC| CME Group will select 25 students this spring from a pool of 100 qualified candidates| supporting them in a plan that will ensure a successful transition to four-year programs this fall. A select number of scholars will also be chosen to receive a summer internship at CME Group member clearing firms. To be eligible for the CME Group Award for Star Scholars Achievement| students must graduate this May with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above and a major in math| computer science/information technology| finance or economics.

505,City Crackdown on Outlaw Party Bus Operators Results in 125 Tickets| 28 Cease and Desist Orders,As Chicago prepares to celebrate the New Year| a new City ordinance allowing regulators and Chicago police to crack down on illegal party buses while increasing safety requirements for licensed operators is showing promising results – and helping reduce crime. Since June 1| when the city implemented the new rules under an ordinance championed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel| regulators have issued 125 tickets and 28 cease and desist orders to noncompliant operators. Police have also made 11 illegal weapons and narcotics arrests under the new rules. At the same time| gun violence and drug crimes related to party buses have dropped throughout the city – making for a safer city and an improved consumer experience.  “The ordinance we passed this summer is showing progress|” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “The party is over for illegal party bus operators| and the parties are safer for people using licensed operators. I'm proud of the progress we have made to protect residents and visitors| and looking forward to building on our efforts in 2018." The strengthened rules| passed by the City Council this spring| helps improve safety by requiring party bus licensees to provide each passenger with a summary of acts prohibited on buses| which include unlawful possession of a firearm or controlled substance| security guard if alcohol is present or if the vehicle makes multiple stops. Additionally| the new ordinance requires clearly identifiable signage on licensed large charter/sightseeing vehicles to ensure any buses operating without a license are easy to identify and shut down. The City has imposed nearly $80|000 in penalties to operators found in violation of the party bus ordinance. “As we head to the New Year’s Eve holiday| we want to remind consumers that this tool is there to help ensure their safety as they are celebrating|” said Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. “If a party bus is part of your plan for this weekend| make sure you are dealing with a licensed operator before you book a charter bus or limo.” While Chicago’s new rules have set clear standards for party bus operators in Chicago| a gap still remains for those operating outside the city. In fact| of the 28 cease and desist orders issued to noncompliant vehicles| 18 have yet to comply and are located in the suburbs. To build on the progress made under Chicago’s stricter rules| in 2018 the city will seek new state licensing legislation to better address illegal party bus operators traveling into the City from the suburbs. “Our city ordinance has been a net win for public safety in Chicago|” said BACP commissioner Rosa Escareno. “We are going to take the next step through state legislation to ensure no matter where a party bus company locates their fleet| if they do business in Chicago they had better be serious about ensuring the safety of our communities and the safety of their patrons.” The City will seek several regulatory improvements through state legislation including requiring a state online-registration that helps identify which buses have been properly licensed by the State and passed the required safety inspection| and requiring better State vehicle identification that can be used by City officials.,December 27| 2017

The latest crane marks a 400% increase since 2010| once again breaking records for the most tower cranes to operate in one year since the height of the great recession. “It is not only a historic high.

Due to the building’s orientation on the site| each residence at Renelle on the River will boast stunning city and river views. Residents also will be just steps from the bustling Riverwalk| Michigan Avenue| and Apple’s new flagship riverfront store. It’s thrilling to see this development move forward in the construction process.”  Cranes typically operate on construction sites for over a year and can operate for as long as two years| depending on the size of the development.

583,Mayor Emanuel Interviews My Block| My Hood| My City Founder Jahmal Cole,This week on "Chicago Stories" podcast| Mayor Emanuel interviews Chatham resident and My Block| My Hood| My City founder Jahmal Cole. Hear about Jahmal’s mission of helping Chicago’s youth discover their potential by exposing them to new experiences and opportunities. Jahmal’s journey began when he was a volunteer at Cook County prison| hearing inmates talk about “my block” and “my hood|” but never “my city.” As he said| “they had never been downtown| never been to the lake| never been in an elevator| never called a taxi. Their whole worldview was shaped by the infrastructure of North Lawndale.” He set out to change that by taking them all over Chicago and even across the country. Jahmal may have started My Block| My Hood| My City a few years ago| but its roots go back to his own childhood “growing up” on the Greyhound bus between Chicago and Texas. As he rode through cities and farms| meeting people outside of his Chicago neighborhood| he became exposed to a world neither he nor his friends knew. Today| Jahmal’s moving that experience forward by working with 120 Chicago teenagers every month| exposing them to their own promise| and sharing his message around the world.

587,Mayor Emanuel| Department of Water Management Announce MeterSave Program to Hit 2017 Goals,Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the Department of Water Management (DWM) today announced that the MeterSave program is on track to install 15|000 free water meters in homes across Chicago. This is the fifth consecutive year that the popular program has met its annual goal. On average| MeterSave customers are saving 30 percent on their water bills for a single family home and 43 percent for a two-flat. "Chicago is fortunate to have a natural resource like Lake Michigan as our front-yard|" said Mayor Emanuel. "At a time when the federal government has forgotten the importance of these types of natural resources| programs like the City's MeterSave continue working to save taxpayer dollars while protecting the region's supply of freshwater." Every day| approximately 5.4 million customers| or 42 percent of the Illinois population| depends on DWM for their water making system efficiency and conservation a priority. Chicago’s MeterSave program| which installs residential water meters free of charge| is designed to promote water conservation. Any resident current on their water bills who owns a single family home or two-flat qualifies for the program. More than 117|000 new meters have been installed since the program began in 2009.  “This program has been so successful because people are seeing considerable savings|” said Randy Conner| DWM Commissioner. “With completely free installation and a seven-year guarantee that bills will be no higher than they would be without a meter| there is no downside to participating.” Non-metered customers pay a flat fee for water every six months. Metered customers pay only for the water they actually use. This amount tends to be well below the estimate calculated by the non-metered payment formula. The program also offers indoor or outdoor water conservation kits as incentives for signing up. For more information| Chicago residents can call 3-1-1 or visit www.metersave.org.,November 2| 2017

590,Mayor Emanuel Expands Local Fight Against Opioid Epidemic,Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) today announced increased efforts to expand Chicago’s fight against the opioid epidemic facing cities and towns across the nation. As part of the Mayor’s 2018 budget proposal| the City will invest an additional $500|000 for a total investment of$2.95 million to prevent and treat substance use disorders. The proposed $500|000 will support an additional 500 individuals in 2018| through Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) and recovery homes| evidence-based practices helping Chicago residents working to overcome addictions to opioids.  “Overdose deaths from heroin and other opioids are skyrocketing across the country| but Chicago is answering the challenge by investing in our communities and working together to find new solutions|” said Mayor Emanuel. “Chicago is investing in treatment and recovery services because we know people can overcome addiction with the proper supports.” As part of the City’s ongoing efforts| CDPH is expanding outreach and education. This week CDPH launched www.overcomeopioids.com| a new online resource hub providing information about services and providers for residents| their family members| and community advocates. Later this year| CDPH will also issue a new Request for Proposal (RFP) to support community health workers to provide education on overdose prevention| naloxone administration| and treatment options.  CDPH also released its latest Epidemiology Report analyzing overdose deaths involving opioids in Chicago from 2015 to 2016. According to the report released by CDPH| there were 741 fatal opioid-related overdoses in Chicago in 2016| an increase of 74 percent from 2015. Following trends seen in other cities| the majority of the increase in opioid-related overdose deaths can be attributed to increases in fentanyl-related overdoses| an opioid that is 50-100 times stronger than heroin. In Chicago| more than 90 percent of overdose deaths were from heroin use or illicit fentanyl. The increased investment provides critical resources at a time when the opioid crisis is worsening both around the country and in Chicago. The new report also shows that every ethnic group| every adult age group and every neighborhood has been impacted. Of all Chicago residents who died of opioid-related overdose in 2016| African American residents account for 48 percent| White residents 34 percent and Latino residents 17 percent. Residents between the ages of 45 and 64 account for nearly half of all opioid-related deaths. Residents of 73 of Chicago’s 77 neighborhoods died of an opioid overdose. “Addiction impacts every one of us| and it is our shared responsibility to provide the resources| information and evidence-based treatment necessary to help overcome opioids|” said CDPH Commissioner Julie Morita| M.D. “By investing in expanded medication assisted treatment| community health workers and education| we are better equipped to face these ongoing challenges.” These efforts to combat opioid addiction follow recommendations made in October 2016 by the Chicago and Cook County Task Force on Heroin| which Mayor Emanuel took a lead role in convening. Under the Mayor’s leadership| the City has undertaken numerous efforts to fight opioid addiction. In 2014| the City sued five big drug companies for deceptive marketing of prescription opioids and for misleading experts and patients about the risks of OxyContin and other opioids| helping to fuel the opioid epidemic. In 2016| Mayor Emanuel reached a major agreement with Pfizer to ensure strict standards in its marketing and promotion of opioids. As part of this work| the City is developing a community and provider education effort privately funded at $375|000 by Pfizer| CVS| Walgreens and Filler Foundation. In addition| the Chicago Police Department is conducting a pilot program that diverts low-level drug offenders to treatment in lieu of an arrest and criminal record. In July 2017| the City of Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection and CDPH announced the new Regulated Business License for Pharmaceutical Representatives to support the City’s efforts to stop deceptive marketing and curb addiction to opioids and other prescription drugs. Any person who markets or promotes pharmaceuticals in Chicago is required to obtain a license| complete mandatory ethics training| receive continuing education and be subject to potential disclosure of their interactions with health care professionals| including gifts. The license has up freed up $700|000 a year and allows CDPH to provide opioid addiction support to an additional 1|000 Chicago residents who live primarily on the south and west sides.

Each site aligns closely with Amazon’s criteria and offers the common strengths of Chicago’s diverse and talented workforce| unparalleled transportation systems and ability to quickly reach any destination in the world. Yet each site also offers a unique set of features that will allow Amazon to tailor a space to meet its needs today| and the needs of the company it will become.  The proposed sites would allow Amazon to be at the very center of a vibrant downtown core| or in an innovative urban district in one of Chicago’s neighborhoods| or in a campus-like environment in our suburbs. City Core  Chicago’s city core| anchored by the "Loop" hub of the CTA’s elevated train system| is the city's central business district and serves as the center of the region’s transportation and communications systems while supporting continued growth all around it.  The Downtown Gateway District is a collection of existing move-in ready buildings| major renovation and new development opportunities at a major gateway to Chicago's business district. This district includes significant space in the Willis Tower| the landmark art deco Old Post Office and new innovative over-site development at Union Station. 18 million sq. ft. of office is available over five existing buildings and seven development sites. A major development site at Union Station| and three new A+ office towers| are the centerpiece.  City Center Campus offers Amazon a unique opportunity to become an integral part of Chicago's Loop.

Commuter rail lines with connections to the surrounding suburban destinations (Union| Ogilvie and Millennium Stations) are less than one-half mile away. Innovative Urban Districts  Chicago is seeing major growth north| west and south of the Central Business District (CBD)| including former industrial districts that have become new and diverse communities. These large-scale sites in the immediate vicinity of the CBD would allow Amazon to define an entire new district. Most have a public waterfront presence along either the Chicago River or Lake Michigan and active owners with investment strategies and design options that can be tailored to meet Amazon’s needs. Lincoln Yards is comprised of over 70 riverfront acres between Bucktown and Lincoln Park| two of Chicago’s most iconic neighborhoods. It is a site of scale that offers robust| existing and multimodal transit connectivity| fiber rich infrastructure| a reasonable cost of living| vibrant neighborhood adjacency and immediate development opportunities with future expansion options.  The River District is a new neighborhood in Chicago’s city center| anchored by 37 acres of continuous riverfront land. Located at the confluence of Chicago’s most dynamic office| residential and entertainment districts| The River District is proximate to five separate CTA train stations| the Union Station/Ogilvie downtown commuter train hubs| the interstate highway system| and a dense network of major bus and bike routes. Given its unique locational attributes| the site represents an opportunity to create a new neighborhood that is pedestrian| bike| and transit friendly| while also convenient to regional commuters and international travelers. Fulton Market sits in a 21st Century extension of Chicago’s Central Business District. Once a meat-packing district| it is now a rich mix of office| workspace| restaurants| night-life| hotels and housing intermingled with industry| makers and artists. The District keeps its working grit while being a major draw for start-ups| and multiple recent corporate headquarters relocations. It is now home to Dyson| Glassdoor| Google| Uber| McDonald’s and WeWork – attracting the brightest minds in business and technology to a rapidly maturing business district.,October 20| 2017

The process for designing these programs involves comprehensive community engagement and a streamlined review by both the Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS) and Chicago Public Schools (CPS) to ensure that all programs being supported by city funding are high-quality and prepare students for kindergarten and continued learning. This year| over 18|000 children across the city will have access to a full-day of preschool—an increase of 80 percent since 2011. The additional five sites will accommodate more than 600 additional children across the selected communities. To improve accessibility| the City of Chicago launched a universal preschool application that serves as a one-stop-shop to help parents find programs| assess program quality| and understand their child’s eligibility for their desired site. This online site provides a single point of entry to access a comprehensive menu of over 600 programs for three- and four-year olds available under Chicago CPS| DFSS and city-administered community-based sites citywide. All locations can be found on the City’s easy-to-use| interactive online portal at http://www.chicagoearlylearning.org.

624,2018 Budget to Include Expanded Investments in Rodent Control,Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced today additional service investments in rodent control and rodent abatement with the Department of Streets and Sanitation (DSS).  As part of the 2018 budget| Mayor Emanuel is proposing to add five more crews dedicated solely to rodent baiting and provide an additional $500|000 in funding to support the purchase of over 10|000 more black garbage carts. “Investments in our city services are the cornerstones that help make our communities stronger and move the City of Chicago forward|” said Mayor Emanuel.  “These critical investments in rodent control and garbage carts allow us to continue to provide the best possible service on behalf of residents.” In 2018| the DSS will increase the number of crews dedicated solely to rodent baiting by five crews.  This over $1 million investment is achieved through operational efficiencies within the Department since the implementation of Grid Garbage.  These efficiencies allow DSS to reallocate personnel to perform rodent abatement in 2018.  A total of 30 rodent abatement and rodent prevention crews will be operating in neighborhoods citywide starting in 2018.   The five additional crews builds on the other key investments Mayor Emanuel has done in recent years to combat rodents| including establishing the new Bureau of Rodent Control as part of the 2017 budget| testing a fertility-bait product on rodents| which is designed to reduce reproduction| and piloting the application of dry ice in parks and green spaces to determine if is suitable citywide as an additional rodenticide method.   To date| the City has responded to over 39|000 requests for rodent abatement in 2017| and response times for all rodent abatement requests is down to five days.  On top of increasing the number of crews performing rodent abatement| the City is also increasing the amount of funding for garbage carts in 2018 to $1|500|000| which is one of the largest local revenue budget appropriation for carts in over five years.  To date| the City has responded to over 23|400 cart requests from residents citywide. Moreover| DSS has repaired and refurbished over 10|000 black refuse carts and over 3|000 blue recycling carts in 2016 and to-date in 2017| saving over $660|000 in cart costs.  "With Mayor Emanuel's support| we will continue our zealous fight against rodents| ensuring that every report is addressed within 5 days or less|" said Streets and Sanitation Commissioner Charles L. Williams. "The rodent battle will only benefit from the investment in garbage carts which helps ensure that residents can swap out any damaged carts for a new or refurbished one in a timely manner." Education remains a top priority in rodent abatement. New informational posters are now placed at every baiting location to help residents understand how to eliminate food sources for rodents.  For more information on rodent control services| call 311 or visit www.cityofchicago.org.,October 13| 2017
625,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on President Trump's Actions on Health Care Coverage,“After Americans rejected Trumpcare| the President is single handedly choosing to increase the cost of quality care for the American people. At the same time| he’s making it more complicated for people to enroll in marketplace insurance. The president's actions are harmful and heartless. Americans living in poverty and those working to make ends meet should not suffer because the president is unwilling or unable to improve our health care system. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act| more Chicagoans have quality insurance than ever before. We will work with our partners to make sure all Chicagoans have access| information and assistance for marketplace enrollment this year| even as the President has slashed funding and enrollment time. Open enrollment is from November 1 – December 15.”,October 13| 2017

628,Mayor Emanuel| CDOT and CTA Announce Critical Federal Funding is Secured for New State and Lake Train Station,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced a major step forward in plans to reconstruct and modernize the CTA ‘L’ station at State and Lake Streets| with the approval of a $56.9 million federal grant for design and construction of a new| fully accessible elevated station to serve passengers on five rail lines from all corners of the city. Today’s approval of a federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) grant by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) will allow CDOT to accelerate work in collaboration with the CTA to launch the design process for a new station.  “The CTA hub at State and Lake is an iconic location in the heart of Chicago and it deserves a state-of-the-art station|” Mayor Emanuel said. “This project has been talked about for more than a decade| and now we are moving forward on plans to rebuild this station and ensure a modern and reliable transit system for Chicago’s residents.” The new State/Lake station will be a modern| fully accessible station with wider platforms| built to 21st Century design standards| consistent with the new Washington/Wabash station. The newly announced federal funding is in addition to existing design funding of $5.5 million. It will not cover the full cost of construction| however| and the City plans to seek additional federal funding for construction. “We are pleased to move closer to providing our customers with yet another new| modern station that is fully accessible and is an important part of our goal of enhancing public transit in Chicago|” CTA President Dorval R. Carter| Jr. said. “We thank CMAP for their support of this project| and look forward to working with our partners at CDOT on this transformational project.” “CDOT greatly appreciates today’s decision by CMAP to prioritize this critically important project|” CDOT Commissioner Rebekah Scheinfeld said. “This allocation of funding allows us to step up the design process. As one of the City’s busiest transfer points| State/Lake is critically important for CTA capacity| safety and the economy of the Central Business District. This project will benefit riders coming from all corners of the city.” The current State/Lake station was originally built in 1895| and last year was the second-busiest station on the Loop ‘L’| with more than 3.1 million annual entries. State/Lake is a second CTA elevated project that CDOT is currently working on for the CTA| in addition to the Damen/Green station that is in design phase. The work on the new stations comes on the heels of the opening of three new stations under Mayor Emanuel: the new Washington/Wabash station in August; a new station at Morgan to serve the Green and Pink Lines in 2012 and the new Cermak-McCormick Place Green Line station in 2015. The full cost of the new station will not be determined until the design process progresses| but it is expected that it will exceed the construction cost of the new station at Washington/Wabash of $75 million.  CDOT| which will manage the project for the CTA| expects to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) before the end of the year for design services for Phases 1 and 2 of the new station| moving the City towards setting a timetable for construction.,October 12| 2017
629,Mayor Emanuel Launches the City of Chicago's Redesigned Website,Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the Department of Innovation and Technology today launched the redesigned City of Chicago website (http://cityofchicago.org).

632,Various Measures Introduced to and Approved by the Chicago City Council,Below please find press releases announcing various measures introduced to the Chicago City Council today.,October 11| 2017
633,Mayor Emanuel's Drive Electric Chicago Effort Gets $15 Million Grant for Electric Vehicles and Charging Stations,Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced that the City’s Drive Electric Chicago program received a major boost today from the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning’s (CMAP) approval of a $15.5 million federal grant for new charging stations and almost 200 electric vehicles (EV’s)| including six electric buses to serve passengers at the City’s two airports| improvements that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 10|000 tons. “The City of Chicago is committed to leading by example toward a more sustainable future by increasing the size of our electric vehicle fleet and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases|” Mayor Emanuel said. “Chicago is rejecting the Trump Administration’s denial of settled science and redoubling our commitment to meeting the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.” Today’s decision by CMAP provides $15.5 million in funding from the Federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program that will allow for the investment in 182 EV’s that will be added to the City’s vehicle fleet| plus nine DC-Fast Charging stations| and 182 Level 2 charging stations. These investments put the City of Chicago on track to attain the goal of a passenger fleet that is 25 percent EV by 2023. The Chicago Department of Aviation (CDA) will install| operate| and maintain 80 Level 2 and 20 Fast Chargers at O'Hare International Airport (O’Hare) and Chicago Midway International Airport (Midway). Charging access at both international airports will enable efficient recharging of Chicago’s growing number of electric taxicabs| limousines| shuttles| and rideshare vehicles serving the airports’ 100 million plus passengers each year.  Additionally| CDA will operate a fleet of 6 electric shuttle buses to service airport parking facilities| including the new Consolidated Rental Car facility| replacing an existing diesel-operated service. The buses will be supported by at least 2 fast charging stations. The e-shuttle fleet will be in operation 24-hours a day. The sustainability effort will improve the fuel efficiency of the City’s fleet| improve air quality| reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support broader adoption of electric vehicles. Officials estimate the program is estimated to reduce petroleum use by 32|906 barrels| greenhouse gas emissions by 10|421 tons| the equivalent of carbon sequestered from 12|300 acres of U.S. forest in one year.  The development of a robust charging network for City fleet vehicles enables the Department of Fleet and Facility Management to electrify portions of the light- and medium-duty fleet including all City flex fleet vehicles. Electrifying the Flex Fleet program will provide over 1300 City employees with first-hand EV driving experience. Mayor Emanuel has been leading the national and global response to the Trump administration’s efforts to gut environmental laws and sustainability efforts. He announced last month that Chicago will host the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy’s North American Climate Summit and the 2017 C40 Cities Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards on December 4-5. The Summit will bring together municipal leaders from across the United States| Canada and Mexico to articulate commitments to the Paris Agreement while the Awards will recognize the world’s most innovative and impactful efforts by mayors to tackle climate change Since the announcement that the U.S. was pulling out of the Paris Agreements| cities across the country and the world have committed to creating a sustainable future for their residents.  Mayor Emanuel joined over 300 Mayors from around the country to commit to the Paris Agreement as part of the Mayors National Climate Agenda| or Climate Mayors. This network of U.S. mayors — representing over 56 million Americans in red states and blue states — work together to strengthen local efforts for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting efforts for binding federal and global-level policy making. Mayor Emanuel also joined over 1|000 state| local| and business leaders from across the country as part of the “We’re Still In” campaign| coming together to signal the importance of the Paris Accord both nationally and across the world. In addition| Mayor Emanuel has worked with cities around the country to post research from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Change Website after the Trump administration unceremoniously removed it from the federal government’s websites on April 29. The research can be found on the City of Chicago’s “Climate Change is Real” website| www.cityofchicago.org/climatechangeisreal. ,October 11| 2017
634,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on Clean Power Plan,“The Trump Administration's attempt to roll back the Clean Power Plan is shortsighted and does not make climate change any less real. This is a blatant attempt to satisfy special interests| and will turn back the clock on progress made across the country in reducing emissions while developing a 21st century economy and creating jobs. Chicago has demonstrated that growing the economy and creating jobs can coexist with reducing your carbon footprint| and we will continue to do both. From creating transparency around energy use to supporting renewable energy development to bringing cities together to discuss our actions on climate during the upcoming North American Climate Summit| Chicago is committed to taking up the reins of leadership on climate change.” Background:,October 10| 2017
635,Mayor Emanuel Announces Major Step Towards Construction of Public Safety Training Academy,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced a major step towards construction of the new Public Safety Training Academy in West Garfield Park. This week the Chicago Infrastructure Trust (CIT) in coordination with the City of Chicago will issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for the design| construction and financing of the new 30-acre training campus on the West Side. The consolidated centralized training academy will improve interagency collaboration in emergency response| and emphasize hands-on tactical training in real-world situations. “This academy will ensure Chicago’s public safety officials have the best tools| technology and training to best serve Chicago’s residents|” Mayor Emanuel said. “Today we are moving forward with the process to build it| making a major investment in West Garfield Park and in public safety for every neighborhood in Chicago.”The new campus will include indoor and outdoor training spaces that both extend the current training capabilities of the Police and Fire Departments as well as offer more joint-training opportunities. The state of the art training campus will include two buildings| employee parking and an outdoor training area with key functions like indoor shooting range| diving pool| conventional classrooms| conference rooms| administrative offices| auditorium| practice range and fitness facilities. The site will also include specialized simulation facilities for active scenario training| ranging from buildings| to CTA train cars| to city streets. It will also have a driving training pad and modular units for scenario base training as well as space for Fire Department extraction training| high-rise operations| search-and-rescue| and confined space rescue training.Together| these features will ensure the new training academy will not only improve interagency collaboration in emergency response| but also expand the capacity for first responders to receive specialized hands-on tactical training in real-world situations."This moves us a step closer to a combined facility that will proved not only classroom study but has the space and infrastructure to do highly realistic scenarios for both police and fire|" Fire Commissioner Jose Santiago said.“Training is at the heart of keeping our police officers safe| reducing gun violence| and improving our service to the city|” CPD First Deputy Superintendent Kevin Navarro said. “The new Public Safety Training Academy will help us to better prepare Chicago police officers to safely and professionally handle the wide variety of situations they may face. I would like to thank Mayor Emanuel and the City Council for their ongoing support of CPD and helping us to be a better agency for every Chicagoan| including our officers.”The RFQ for Design-Build-Finance entities will be issued this week; responses are due at 4 P.M. CST on Nov. 20| 2017. A copy of the RFQ will be available for download at www.ChicagoInfrastructure.org. A pre-submittal conference and networking event will be held at the Garfield Park Conservatory at 10 A.M. on October 25th."I enthusiastically support this project| which will be a definite win-win for the city's diverse west side communities|” Alderman Emma Mitts (37th) said. “It will provide a strong economic investment| creating jobs and expanding resources in the 37th Ward| while increasing public safety for residents in every part of Chicago. I look forward to getting started and breaking ground.”The move is the latest by the Emanuel administration to improve local neighborhoods through innovative partnerships. In February| the Mayor announced 2FM headquarters would move from West Town to Englewood (69th and Wentworth Ave.)| along with 200 jobs. The new facility will be funded in part by proceeds from the sale of the site on N. Throop Street. Additionally| a new branch library on the Near West Side and a new fire station on the Near North Side are being planned through public-private partnerships with local developers. Last week the Mayor announced the City Colleges of Chicago is accepting bids for its downtown headquarters building in preparation for a move closer to its students in the neighborhoods.The estimated cost for the proposed Public Safety Training Academy| including land acquisition| is $95 million. A portion of the Project funding will be from the sale of city-owned land at 1685 N. Throop St. Following a competitive bidding process| the City has reached a tentative agreement to sell the 18-acre site to local developer Sterling Bay for $104.7 million| or $133.53 per square foot. Closing is expected to occur later this year. At least $20 million of the sale of 1685 N. Throop St. will go towards the Public Safety Training Academy| which will support design and construction of the new academy.,October 10| 2017
636,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on President Trump's Immigration Proposal,"President Trump is turning his back on Dreamers and doubling down on dangerous| divisive anti-immigrant policies which would tear families apart| deport law-abiding children to countries they have never known and break America's promise to bright| hard-working young people who are part of the fabric of American society. Chicago will always remain a Welcoming City| stand up for our values and stand by Dreamers who are our classmates| coworkers| friends and neighbors. Congress should not bend to pressure from the Trump Administration| they should codify America's commitment to Dreamers without caving to President Trump's destructive demands.",October 9| 2017

639,Mayor Rahm Emanuel Announces Chicago Energy Rating System for Large Buildings,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today proposed a Chicago Energy Rating System that makes energy use information for large buildings easily accessible to Chicagoans while encouraging energy savings. Once passed by City Council| the proposed ordinance will use buildings existing and publicly available energy data alongside recent energy improvements to rate buildings on a zero to four star scale. Buildings will be required to post ratings in a prominent location on the property| and share this information at the time of sale or lease listing. Chicago is one of the first US cities to assign buildings an energy performance rating and require properties to post their rating. “By providing simplicity and transparency around building performance| we are giving Chicagoans the tools to better understand energy consumption|” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “This updated ordinance will help drive cost-saving measures for energy efficiency| and will support the development of 21st century jobs for local residents and businesses.” Large buildings are one of the most significant contributors to greenhouse gases in Chicago| comprising 20% of the city’s carbon emissions and spending over $650 million annually in energy costs.  The proposal builds on the City’s existing Energy Benchmarking Ordinance| which requires buildings over 50|000 square feet to measure and report energy use once per year. These buildings currently receive a 1-100 ENERGY STAR score from the US Environmental Protection Agency| based on that building’s energy performance versus like buildings around the country while taking into account occupancy| operational characteristics and Chicago’s climate zone. Buildings that have complied for two or three consecutive years to date have saved an estimated $17.8 million in energy costs per year and have reduced weather normalized energy use by up to 4 percent. The Rating applies to the 3|500 properties already required to annually benchmark energy data| and imposes no additional cost. It will use the building’s most recent score and recent energy improvements to calculate the star rating.  Buildings with one to three stars can earn an additional star by improving their ENERGY STAR score by 10 points or more.  If all buildings with ENERGY STAR scores below 90 were to improve their scores by only 10 points to earn one additional star in the new Rating| buildings would see savings of over $70 million per year.  In addition the investments needed to achieve these savings would generate over 1|000 clean energy jobs. “The work we do with Chicagoans everyday on smarter energy use helps to create jobs and reduce our environmental footprint|” said Anne Evens| CEO of Elevate Energy. “The Mayor's Chicago Energy Rating System increases transparency to building owners and tenants of their energy use which will help spur investments in our city's buildings.” While reporting will continue to be mandated| buildings will not be required to make changes to improve energy efficiency. Buildings that do not comply with the energy benchmarking ordinance will receive zero out of four stars. In addition to posting the star rating publicly on site and providing it at the time of sale or lease| the City will post ratings on the Chicago Data Portal. More information on the current benchmarking ordinance and the Mayor’s Energy Rating System can be found at www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking.  "As Chicago expands its energy efficiency benchmarking ordinance| the city is demonstrating global leadership towards fighting climate change|” said Jen Walling| Executive Director| Illinois Environmental Council. “Energy efficiency is an inexpensive| consumer friendly way to reduce carbon emissions from buildings.  The expanded ordinance will give building owners and tenants more information and greater ability to lower bills and reduce environmental impacts." The Chicago Energy Rating Systems builds upon Chicago’s strategy to reduce harmful carbon pollution. In April| the Mayor announced that by 2025 all of Chicago’s public buildings will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. That transition means that eight percent of the city-wide electricity load or 1.8 billion kilowatt hours will come from clean and renewable sources. This follows the 2013 commitment that the City made to eliminating coal from its electricity supply. Earlier this year| the City of Chicago was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2017 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award. The award is given annually to honor organizations that have made outstanding contributions to protecting the environment through energy efficiency and recognized the four years of successful implementation of the City’s Energy Benchmarking Ordinance. The award also recognized the Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenge and its 79 member buildings covering 53.1 million square feet-all of which have committed to reducing their energy use by 20 percent.  In July| the City of Chicago was ranked number one in the nation for energy efficiency office buildings| according to the 2017 National Green Building Adoption Index published by CBRE Group Inc. and Maastricht University. The city increased its percentage of green office space square footage by 6.5 percent in the last year| growing LEED or Energy Star certified city office buildings to 66 percent. The study ranked 30 of the largest real estate markets in the country and specifically cites Mayor Emanuel’s Benchmarking Ordinance and other aggressive policy measures as catalysts for green building expansion.,October 8| 2017
640,Mayor Emanuel and the Chicago Department of Aviation Break Ground on New Security Checkpoint Project at Midway,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today joined the Chicago Department of Aviation (CDA)| airport partners| elected officials and members of the community for the groundbreaking on a new security checkpoint and bridge expansion project at Midway International Airport. A new 80|000-square foot security pavilion will allow for additional security lanes| enhanced technology and a single checkpoint system that will double Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screening capacity and increase efficiency for passengers. “Today| wait times at Chicago’s airports are among the best in the nation because we have taken steps to improve efficiency| while ensuring more than 100 million passengers can travel safely through Midway and O’Hare each year|” said Mayor Emanuel. “Our investments in security| the first step in Midway's modernization| are more important now than ever before. Over the next three years| we will transform Midway into a truly world class airport at no cost to taxpayers| while creating hundreds of jobs right here in the community.” The kick off of the security checkpoint marks the beginning of construction on the Midway Modernization Program—a $323 million investment announced by Mayor Emanuel in 2015 to deliver the airport’s most significant capital upgrade in nearly two decades. “Each year| more than 22 million people travel through Chicago’s Midway Airport| connecting passengers to destinations around the country—and even a few beyond our borders. This expanded security checkpoint will create jobs| and lead to a safer and more convenient travel experience that will further solidify Midway’s position as a critical transportation hub|” U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) said. “I’m committed to working with the City of Chicago| TSA| and the airlines to ensure Midway has the resources it needs to continue to grow and thrive.” The new security structure and expansion of the pedestrian bridge will provide for a streamlined| single checkpoint area seven times wider than the current security hall and featuring new technology. This development| combined with new TSA automated lanes| is expected to increase the hourly throughput from 2|500 to 5|000 passengers per hour—double the existing capacity. “Chicago’s airports are well-equipped to provide a safe and efficient experience to the traveling public| and to continue offering efficient wait times| thanks to our partnerships with the TSA and airlines|” said CDA Commissioner Ginger S. Evans. “With our passengers’ experience top of mind| security improvements like these continue to be a focal point as we embark on major development projects to ensure our airports are prepared for growing traveler volumes in the years ahead.” By 2019| the addition of new lanes and technology will prepare the airport to meet forecasted passenger demand. With the FAA estimating that air travel in the U.S. is expected to double in the next 20 years| Chicago has already seen its passenger volumes increase. New security technology features installed under this project will improve checkpoint efficiency as the expansion is made| and ensure that as higher volumes of travelers are processed| that the highest levels of security are maintained. “As a senior member of the House Transportation Committee and the Aviation Subcommittee| as well as the representative of Midway Airport| it’s great to join with Mayor Emmanuel and the Department of Aviation to announce this vital improvement for Midway.  Because the airport was rebuilt before 9-11| the security checkpoint sometimes becomes a chokepoint for passengers.  Once this project is complete| Midway Airport will be an even more convenient option for airline passengers|” said U.S. Congressman Dan Lipinski. Over the next two years| the $104 million security checkpoint project will create 470 new construction jobs. In total| the Midway Modernization Program—spanning the redevelopment of Midway’s concessions and terminal garage—will create at least 1|700 jobs and stimulate economic activity throughout the region. "Moving travelers in and out of Midway in the most efficient| expedited| and safe manner must be a fundamental characteristic of an international airport like Midway Airport. In addition| creating over 1|000 new construction jobs is good for the local economy|” said Senator Martin Sandoval| Chairman of the Illinois Senate Transportation Committee. Beyond the expanded capacity for TSA screening functions| the project will contribute to other aspects of the Midway Modernization plan by adding 18|000 square feet for new concession opportunities. Midway’s expanded concessions program will significantly increase dining and shopping options for travelers and generate additional non-airline revenue for the airport. “We applaud Mayor Emanuel for his vision to modernize our largest operation| and we are pleased to invest in this expansion that will enhance the travel experience for our passengers as they move through Midway|" said Craig Vaughn| Director of Stations| Southwest Airlines| Co.. "The Southwest team is always looking to improve the customer experience| and we look forward to the modernization benefitting our tens of thousands of passengers in Chicago each day| as well as those in the community." Security enhancements are underway today at Midway with the installation of new automated screening lanes by the TSA| set to be operational by the end of this month. Midway joins a small number of U.S. airports to feature this innovative technology| which is designed to improve the screening process by automating many of the functions previously conducted manually| and allowing travelers to move more swiftly and efficiently through the checkpoint. “The technology enhancements made by the City of Chicago today mean that Midway will be even better positioned tomorrow to continue providing travelers a safe and smooth travel experience|" Kevin McCarthy| TSA Federal Security Director  for Midway. "Working with our partners at the City of Chicago| we are committed to leveraging the technology and resources that will contribute to an efficient checkpoint experience| but more importantly to ensure the highest level of security for our passengers.” To engage residents in opportunities created by this project| the CDA will continue its ongoing outreach efforts by facilitating a career fair for residents seeking employment in partnership with the project's lead contractor| F.H. Paschen. In addition to CDA’s rigorous community hiring requirements| the contractor has committed to hiring 10 apprenticeship positions| and will conduct its first outreach this fall. Construction of the security checkpoint will be divided into three phases to minimize the impact to the flow of traffic on Cicero Avenue. CDA will work with its partners at the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) to mitigate and inform the surrounding community of traffic impacts as a result of this project as they occur. Rolling| partial lane closures are expected to occur during specific evening hours as soon as next week. The project’s phasing plan also ensures passengers can continue to clear security and get to their gate efficiently while the bridge construction is underway. For updates on traffic| and on progress of the full Midway Modernization Program| the CDA has launched a new website to deliver key information to passengers as well as the general public. The website| www.mdwmod.com| was designed to feature regular updates on construction of the three key Midway Modernization Projects| as well as information that will help travelers plan accordingly and minimize the impact of construction on travel plans. The site will also post information about career fairs and job opportunities for residents.,October 6| 2017

These ambitious goals are driven by the Mars Food purpose: Better Food Today. A Better World Tomorrow.

646,Mayor Emanuel Announces Applications to Open This Week for Second Round of Neighborhood Opportunity Fund Investments,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced applications for $2.5 million in Neighborhood Opportunity Fund grants will be available on Oct. 4. Launched earlier this year| the initiative generates funding from downtown development projects to support neighborhood commercial corridor growth on Chicago’s south| southwest and west sides.  “This second round of investments will support even more neighborhood entrepreneurs on Chicago’s south| southwest and west sides|” Mayor Emanuel said. “By linking growth downtown directly to growth in our neighborhoods we can create jobs and new community amenities and ensure the entire city of Chicago thrives for generations to come.” The applications will be available at www.neighborhoodopportunityfund.com and are due on Dec. 22| 2017. In June| the Mayor announced the first round of $3.2 million in funding through the program| which is going to 32 businesses across the city| including a vegan restaurant in Chatham| a plant nursery in North Lawndale and an art gallery in West Humboldt Park. The initial recipients were selected from more than 700 applications to the program| created by Mayor Emanuel through reforms to the City’s Zoning Code in the spring of 2016. Approval criteria involve a proposal’s ability to have a measureable| catalytic impact on a community or commercial corridor| based on the availability of similar goods or services and project feasibility| among other factors. Funding for the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund is generated from voluntary payments made by downtown development projects. The payments are in exchange for density bonuses that allow developers to exceed zoning limits for a specific development site. Eighty percent of the payments are applied to the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund for distribution to eligible projects within the West and South sides. The remainder is split in support of infrastructure improvements downtown and improvements to landmark buildings across the city. Eligible costs for Neighborhood Opportunity Fund grants include property acquisition and rehabilitation| small business training| and local hiring subsidies. Up to 65 percent of total project costs are eligible for funding through the program. Grants that exceed $250|000 require City Council approval. Project eligibility is limited to low-to-moderate income areas. The program is administered by the Department of Planning and Development. “This second round of funding through the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund will generate even more critical support for retail and commercial projects in neighborhoods that need them|” Planning Commissioner David Reifman said. “That means more jobs| goods and services that create a foundation for more public and private investment and stability.”,October 2| 2017
647,City Colleges of Chicago Now Accepting Bids for its Downtown Headquarters Building,As City Colleges of Chicago plans to relocate its administrative office| would-be owners of a prime downtown Chicago property have an opportunity to place a bid on its significant headquarters building in Chicago’s West Loop. The community college system announced today that it has officially put the building up for sale and engaged real estate firm CBRE to market it on CCC’s behalf. “The sale of the administrative office building will enable City Colleges to invest more across our campuses| in our communities and will bring the staff closer to its students|” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “This represents another step forward towards ensuring City Colleges students are prepared with the tools and resources necessary to succeed in 21st century careers.”  Among the relocation options CCC is considering is the utilization of space available on its Kennedy-King College campus in Englewood as well as at its Dawson Technical Institute in Bronzeville. City Colleges will also seek an additional small office space for staff to remain in the central business district. The community college system aims to close on the downtown headquarters building with a new buyer by the end of its FY18 fiscal year in late spring. The 185|000-square foot classically-styled office building located at 226 W. Jackson just east of the Willis Tower| represents an outstanding opportunity for redevelopment for office| hotel| residential or retail uses. It sits on 17|400 square feet at the Northeast corner of Jackson and Franklin and is currently zoned by the City of Chicago as “Downtown Core 16.” This flexible zoning allows mixed-use development that will continue the trend of repurposing significant older downtown buildings into modern offices| hotels or residences that has revitalized the Loop in recent years.  “By selling what is an underutilized asset| we will have greater resources to invest in our colleges| in our students| in our communities| all the while achieving a closer relationship between our staff and students|” said Chancellor Juan Salgado. “The recently announced $500 million renovation plans for the Willis Tower along with the redevelopment of the Old Chicago Main Post Office| the growing residential population downtown and the resulting increases in commercial and retail traffic makes this an ideal time to sell our well-located Loop property.”  Earlier this summer| CCC Chancellor Juan Salgado announced the intended sale of the District’s headquarters building in a move intended to right size operations and shift more resources to its colleges located in Chicago neighborhoods. Moving administrative staff to CCC campuses around the city from a building that currently records only 33% occupancy aligns with the Chancellor’s strategy to shift greater focus to the system’s seven colleges and five satellite sites while shoring up the district’s long-term financial health. “The sale of our building is a win-win financially and strategically for the students of City Colleges|” continued Salgado. “Relocating our administrative staff will put them in greater proximity to our students| allowing us to serve them better at a time when our emphasis is on providing students with an exceptional educational and student service experience. The sale of the building will ensure CCC has the financial resources to continue serving the students of Chicago and changing the trajectory of their lives through a quality education.” Conveniently based in the heart of the LaSalle financial district| the building offers great access to the Quincy CTA stop| Union and Ogilvie Stations| and has easy access to major expressways. The daytime business population within a one-mile is over 500|000 and the nearby residential population continues to grow. City Colleges of Chicago has enlisted the services of CBRE| Inc. in facilitating the sale of the property. A brochure offering extensive details about the building at 226 W. Jackson – its amenities and development possibilities – is available| and interested parties may contact Martin Stern| Senior Managing Director of CBRE at 312.456.7070| martin.stern@cbre.com.,October 2| 2017

"Chicago is home to a proud Puerto Rican community| and since Hurricane Maria struck| Chicagoans on every level have responded not only with our hearts| but with our wallets to help our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico|" said Mayor Emanuel. "We will continue to support the people of Puerto Rico rebuild and recover from this terrible tragedy| and continue to welcome countless families with open arms."  On Wednesday| 23 members of the Chicago Fire Department including firefighters| paramedics| EMTs and engineers will fly to Puerto Rico with defibrillators| stretchers| communications equipment and other supplies. The delegation will spend 10 days on the island and provide an on-the-ground assessment of additional resources needed. The Mayor and the Congressman coordinated with United Airlines to deliver much needed supplies from Chicago to the island| and welcomed evacuees as they arrived at O'Hare last week. The Congressman returned from a visit to Puerto Rico on Sunday and was able to provide a first-hand account of the current conditions and talk about the resources still needed. “Puerto Rican's on the island are working hard under difficult circumstances but are making progress hand in hand with FEMA| private groups and US cities and towns sending aid They need communications| helicopters| engineers and organizational support| which should come from the US military immediately because some people still haven't been contacted| supplied or rescued|" said Congressman Gutierrez. "Right now on the mainland and in Chicago we should be thinking about evacuation and how we give refugees from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands a safe place to recuperate until things improve." On September 25| 2017| United Airlines began humanitarian efforts for residents impacted by Hurricane Maria. The Chicago Department of Aviation led an operation to receive evacuees on these humanitarian flights. A reception area was set up in conjunction with additional city agencies| the Red Cross and The Salvation Army to address immediate needs (i.e.| mental health services| personal items| and hydration items). Once in Chicago| United provided the residents services including a one night hotel stay and connecting travel to alternate destinations.

649,Mayor Emanuel and Alderman Burke Announce City of Chicago Has Filed Lawsuit Against Equifax Over Recent Data Breach,Mayor Rahm Emanuel| Chairman Edward M. Burke| and Chicago Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel today announced that the City of Chicago has filed a lawsuit against Equifax to ensure that the company is held accountable for its recent data breach and its failure to give timely notice to Chicago residents| as well as to force the company to offer remedies and restitution to those impacted by the breach.  “Chicago residents have been unnecessarily exposed to financial risks due to Equifax’s irresponsible and reckless actions that prioritized profit over the privacy and safety of consumer data|” said Mayor Emanuel.  “We are taking action to hold this company accountable and to protect the residents of Chicago.” From at least March 7| 2017 through July 30| 2017| Equifax left at least 143 million – with more than 5 million in Illinois – consumers’ sensitive and private information exposed and vulnerable to intruders by relying on certain open-source code  that Equifax knew or should have known was insecure and subject to exploitation.  Although patches| workarounds| and other fixes for the related vulnerability were available and known to Equifax| it failed to avail itself of these remedies| or to employ other security controls| such as encryption of data or multiple layers of security| that would help to protect consumers’ personal data. As a result| hackers were able to access Equifax’s computer system from at least May 13| 2017 through July 30| 2017| and according to Equifax’s own estimates| reportedly stole sensitive and personal information of 143 million consumers.  This data breach| which Equifax first disclosed to the public on September 7| 2017| exposed to still-unknown persons the most sensitive personal and financial data of Chicago residents| including full names| social security numbers| dates of birth| addresses| and for some consumers| credit card numbers| driver’s license numbers| and/or other personally-identifiable information. “I commend Mayor Emanuel and Corporation Counsel Siskel for filing suit against Equifax|” said Chairman Burke. “This is a breach of epic proportions and Equifax should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Chicago citizens rely on City government to protect them.” Chicago’s lawsuit claims that Equifax violated the Illinois Personal Information Privacy Act| the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act and the Chicago Consumer Fraud ordinance by exposing this information| failing to provide prompt notice of the breach and misleading concerned consumers by initially falsely representing that it was offering “complimentary identity theft protection and credit file monitoring” while requiring a waiver from future legal action.  “The evidence in this case clearly points to violations of state law and the city’s consumer protection ordinance| and we have an obligation to any resident who has been impacted to seek remedies and fines as a penalty|” said Corporation Counsel Siskel.   Chicago’s lawsuit seeks civil penalties| restitution| and other available relief to address| remedy and prevent harm to Chicago residents resulting from Equifax’s actions and inactions. The penalty for violating Chicago’s ordinance is a fine of not less than $2|000 nor more than $10|000 for each offense| and each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate and distinct offense to which a separate fine shall apply.,September 28| 2017
650,Mayor Emanuel Unveils Renovated Lobby at Chicago Post Office,Mayor Rahm Emanuel| Ald. Daniel Solis and 601W Companies today announced lobby renovations at Chicago’s old Main Post Office are complete and a 100|000-square-foot showroom will soon demonstrate the 2.8-million-square-foot building’s potential as one of the county’s largest commercial structures. “Today| the historic Post Office takes a major step towards its future and a brighter future for the city of Chicago|” Mayor Emanuel said. “After sitting empty and unused for decades| this iconic building is being renovated and revitalized as an economic engine that impacts neighborhoods across the city.” Three hundred and fifty feet long and 38 feet high| the Art Deco-style lobby served thousands of daily post office patrons during the building’s heyday in the 1900s as the nexus of the U.S. mail system. The work included extensive restoration of the lobby’s white-marble walls| stone floors| gold glass mosaic tiles| monumental windows and light fixtures.   The work is part of a more than $600 million rehabilitation project by 601W that will comprehensively repair and update the remainder of the complex| including all interiors and exterior spaces| building systems| windows| elevators| and common areas. The work will also include repairs and improvements to existing rights-of-way for the Eisenhower Expressway and Amtrak railroad trains in the lower levels of the building. An estimated 15|000 people could work in the building when it is fully leased. The rehabilitation project is projected to generate more than 1|500 construction jobs. The agreement also includes requirements for minority- and women-owned business participation in the work to redevelop the facility. “The Post Office will once again revolutionize the Chicago business landscape and be a hub for the future of commerce|” said Brian Whiting| President of The Telos Group| which oversees strategic positioning and leasing of the office space. “We fully recognize the historical significance of this building and intend to preserve its legacy and grandeur and elevate it into a modern era.” The Post Office| at 433 W. Van Buren St.| was designed by Graham| Anderson| Probst & White and built in phases from 1921 to 1932. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places| it has been vacant since the city’s main post office operations relocated more than 20 years ago. Rehabilitation work started in 2016 after 601W purchased the building from its previous owner through a City-led redevelopment agreement.. Amenities are planned to include a three-acre rooftop park and a grand plaza along a landscaped Riverwalk. “This historic project will bring thousands of jobs to the area and renew a building that has been neglected for decades|” Ald. Solis said. “This renovated lobby and landmark designation are major steps forward| and I look forward to continuing our progress.” The building will be considered for a preliminary Landmark recommendation by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks on Oct. 5| 2017 Mayor Emanuel also announced today. Commission staff is expected to cite the building’s role at the nexus of the country’s mail system| along with its architect| architecture| and unique presence in the West Loop in supporting the recommendation. “The ongoing rehabilitation and landmark designation will ensure this historic gateway to downtown will be a neighborhood asset for years to come|” Department of Planning and Development Commissioner David L. Reifman said. The proposed designation would protect the building’s exteriors and lobby from significant alteration or demolition. If approved by the Landmarks Commission| the designation could be introduced to City Council later this year. New York City-based 601W owns Chicago’s AON Center| Prudential Plaza| and the former Montgomery Ward warehouse at 600 W.

In 2015| the average number of permits issued per month was 169| and through the first half of this year| we have averaged 202 permits per month. Following a commitment to homeowners last fall to issue single-family home renovation permits without special zoning approvals in 30 days or less| the average time to get this permit in 2017 is 25 days (a decrease of 10 days from 2016).  “The Department of Buildings is committed to being a partner| not an obstacle| for building projects|” said Building Commissioner Judy Frydland. “We have laid the groundwork in the last two years with reforms that make it more cost-effective to build and easier to obtain building permits.” Recent reforms implemented under Mayor Emanuel and Department of Buildings Commissioner Judith Frydland include a new Electrical Code approved by City Council in early September| the elimination of multiple dwelling registration| and additional code relief for plumbing| energy| and natural light and ventilation requirements.,September 26| 2017

More than half of the youth will be served through the Mayor’s Mentoring Initiative| which focuses on reaching 8th| 9th and 10th graders from 22 of the City’s highest poverty and highest violence neighborhoods.  This latest expansions bring the City more than 90 percent towards its goal of reaching approximately 7|200 youths by 2018. In early 2017| the City awarded 56 longtime delegate partners and community-based organizations with contracts to increase mentoring to over 4|500 young men. The Mayor’s Mentoring Initiative is a core component of the City’s public safety strategy. It lays out a clear path to provide the most at-risk youth with the support they need to remain on-track to graduate high school and avoid involvement in the criminal justice system. Research by the University of Chicago Crime Lab suggests mentorship has been proven to be an effective strategy for increasing high school graduation rates and reducing violence. The Crime Lab found that BAM reduces violent crime arrests among participants by 45-50 percent| and increases on-time high school graduation rates by 19 percent. New participating schools include: Beasley Elementary| Camelot - Excel Englewood High School| Carson Elementary| Gage Park High School| Gary Elementary| Hernandez Elementary| Kanoon Elementary| Madero Elementary| Nightingale Elementary| Saucedo Elementary| Sawyer Elementary| Seward | Westinghouse High School| Whitney Elementary School| York Elementary| Zapata Elementary.  Since 2011| the Emanuel administration has increased the investment to over 10 times the original amount to expand the BAM mentoring program to more than 6|000 students in 90 schools throughout Chicago this year.,September 22| 2017

661,Mayor Emanuel Launches Historic Streetlight Modernization Program,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today launched the historic modernization of Chicago’s streetlight system by flipping the switch to activate the first four-block stretch to receive the new lights on South Chicago Avenue from 79th to 83rd Streets. The ambitious Chicago Smart Lighting Program will replace 270|000 of Chicago’s public lights with high-quality LED fixtures over the next four years and add a management system that will give the city a state-of-the-art smart lighting grid.   “The Chicago Smart Lighting Program will deliver modern| reliable| energy-efficient lighting that will improve quality of life in every neighborhood and address one of the top reasons people call 311|" Mayor Emanuel said. "This program is a great example of how we are building a new Chicago for the 21st Century." In 2017| streetlight fixture replacement will be focused in neighborhoods with heightened public safety concerns on the west and south sides. This allows communities in the greatest need to most quickly reap the benefits of clearer and more reliable lighting. In addition| during the first twelve months of work| new lights will be installed along key arterial streets in every ward of Chicago| to ensure neighborhoods throughout the City benefit from the improved lighting. The project will also include targeted repairs to poles and wiring to extend the life of existing infrastructure.Also today| the Mayor unveiled the program website: http://chicagosmartlighting.org where Chicagoans will be able to track the progress of the program as new high quality LED streetlights are installed across the City over the next four years.  The new lights| which will be owned and operated by the City| will consume 50-75 percent less electricity than existing high pressure sodium (HPS) lights| generating significant electricity cost savings that will offset the cost of the modernization. LED fixtures also last two-to-three times longer than HPS lights. In addition| ComEd has committed to providing $6.2 million in rebate funding for the program in 2017 as part of the company’s energy efficiency incentive efforts. “CDOT is very excited to launch this massive retrofit project|” CDOT Commissioner Rebekah Scheinfeld said. “The longer life of LED lights will greatly improve the reliability of our lighting and the new smart lighting management system will increase efficiency of city forces by allowing us to respond proactively when outages occur and to restore service more quickly when needed.” The program was procured by the Chicago Infrastructure Trust in close coordination with the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Department of Innovation and Technology. This is the largest project to date from a rebooted CIT| which is dedicated to assisting the City with executing large-scale and complex public projects.  “This project represents a significant investment in Chicago’s future and specifically our neighborhoods|” Chicago Treasurer and CIT Chair Kurt Summers said. “By modernizing our infrastructure| the city will save money over the long term through lower energy costs and vastly improve the lighting on our streets and alleys. This project shows the strength of the CIT and we look forward to continuing other new initiatives that will invest in Chicago in the years to come.” “Residents of the 8th Ward will be very happy to see these modern new LED streetlights installed on our main thoroughfares|” Alderman Michelle Harris said. “These lights will improve nighttime visibility in Chicago’s neighborhoods.”    The project is expected to be completed in four years and cost up to $160 million. The City of Chicago has contracted with a team led by Ameresco Inc.| a national leader in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects| to implement the program.The program includes three components:,September 19| 2017
662,Mayor Emanuel and City Colleges of Chicago Announce Five New Star Scholarship Transfer Partners,City Colleges of Chicago’s (CCC) Star Scholarship program announced five new college and university Star Transfer partnerships today| bringing the total number to 20 of four-year schools giving Star Scholars who graduate from City Colleges additional scholarships towards completion of their bachelor’s degrees.  Saint Xavier University| Kendall College| Marquette University| Southern Illinois University Carbondale and Illinois State University join 15 existing four-year college Star transfer partners whose awards to Star Scholars range from $1|000 up to $50|000/year.  “In the City of Chicago| high school graduation is no longer the last stop on a student’s educational journey and the Star Scholarship removes the burden of cost to receiving a degree|” said Mayor Emanuel. “I am proud of our twenty colleges and universities partners who have taken this a step further and now provide Star Scholars with the opportunity to pursue a high-quality| affordable four-year degree at a school of their choice.”   More than $1 million in additional scholarship funds have been offered to Star Scholars through these transfer partnerships to date. Loyola University has offered the most in scholarships to date ($425|000); University of Illinois at Chicago has accepted the most Star Scholars to date (122); and CME Group| the Star program’s first corporate partner has provided students with 25 $5|000 scholarships and connected 5 CCC students with paid summer internships at elite trading firms. “We have colleges and universities— some of the best in the world— competing for our transfer students|” said City Colleges of Chicago Chancellor Juan Salgado.  “These colleges and universities recognize the value our students bring to their institutions| the contributions they make in and out of the classroom| and the imprint they will make on our economy and world.”In addition to the five new partners| City Colleges has been working with the following universities and colleges to offer Star Scholars additional support once they move on to earn their bachelor’s degree: University of Illinois at Chicago| Columbia College| DePaul University| Dominican University| Governors State University| Illinois Tech| Loyola University| National Louis University| North Park University| Northeastern Illinois University| Northwestern University| Robert Morris University| Roosevelt University| School of the Art Institute of Chicago| and University of Chicago. The combination of these benefits means that a student could obtain a bachelors degree for the cost of 2 or 3 semesters.  For example| a student that earns a semester of credit while in high school (from AP| IB or Dual credit/dual enrollment in City College Courses)| earns a Star scholarship| and then takes advantage of the Star Partnership at the Illinois Institute of Technology could obtain a degree for roughly $40|000 in tuition and fees (using current rates)| compared to $160|000 for your typical in-state student.Since launching its first class in Fall 2015| the Star Scholarship program has seen strong outcomes.  More than 2|900 Star Scholars are enrolled at City Colleges this fall.  67% of the first 890 students in the Fall 2015 cohort have either graduated or are expected to complete by the time their scholarship ends| and this total expected three-year graduation rate for Star Scholars would be nearly triple the national community college graduation rate average.  Furthermore| the percentage of Star Scholars that graduated from CCC in two years was nearly the average national community college graduation rate (22%) after three years. The first year to second year retention rate of Star Scholars (85%) is also nearly double the national average for community college students. Students eligible for the Star Scholarship have graduated from a Chicago Public Schools (CPS) high school with a 3.0 GPA and test nearly college-ready in math and English| and enroll in a City Colleges structured| relevant pathway. The new partnership agreements include:,September 19| 2017
663,Mayor Emanuel Announces Collaborative "Getting to Zero" Initiative that Seeks to Effectively Eliminate New HIV Infections by 2027,CHICAGO – Today| Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced his support for a new collaborative effort to finally eliminate new diagnoses of HIV in Chicago and throughout the state in just ten years. The new “Getting To Zero” (GTZ) initiative includes two key tenets: first| increasing the use of prevention medications among those most vulnerable to the disease; second| ensuring that 70% of all people living with HIV receive the necessary medication to reduce their viral load| which significantly reduces the risk of transmission. GTZ is a collective effort of the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH)| the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and 10 community organizations and hospitals.  “We are more equipped than ever to fight HIV|” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel.  “With the aid of strong community health care partnerships| new treatments and the increased availability of medication to vulnerable populations we have a real chance at stopping the spread of HIV once and for all.” GTZ is a statewide effort of CDPH| IDPH| AIDS Foundation of Chicago| Alexian Brothers Housing and Health Alliance| Center on Halsted| Chicago Black Gay Men’s Caucus| Howard Brown Health| Illinois Public Health Association| Lake County Health Department| Northwestern University| Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center and University of Chicago. The plan was developed following models from Washington State| San Francisco and other jurisdictions to use existing resources and building on effective programs that provide the greatest potential for reducing HIV transmission. Scientific modeling suggests that by increasing the utilization of PrEP| the daily pill that reduces the risk of becoming infected with HIV by more than 90 percent| from 20 percent to 40 percent| and also increasing adherence to antiretroviral treatment among those living with HIV from 50 percent to 70 percent| HIV in Chicago will reach a point where it can no longer sustain itself| or “functional zero.”  Chicago has made significant progress over the years reducing the spread of HIV. There have been fewer than 1|000 new HIV cases annually since 2013| down from a high of 1|850 new cases in 2002. In Chicago| 48 percent of people living with HIV are virally suppressed| meaning they are less likely to transmit the virus. Even though this number is on par with the national average of 49 percent| there is still room for improvement to ensure more people living with HIV are healthy and are less likely to transmit the virus. ,September 19| 2017

The awards will celebrate the most ambitious and innovative efforts by mayors of the world’s great cities to tackle climate change| and will focus on five key categories: building energy efficiency & clean energy; sustainable transportation; reducing waste; climate action plans| and adaptation plans & programs.  Finalists include twenty-five projects from twenty-two cities| and include Retrofit Chicago. Retrofit Chicago encompasses the city’s efforts to reduce energy use in public buildings| private buildings| and municipal operations.Since the Trump administration’s announcement to pull out of the Paris Agreements| cities across the United States and around of the world have shown their commitment to creating a truly sustainable future for their residents. More than 377 Mayors from around the country have committed to the Paris Agreement as part of the Mayors National Climate Agenda| or Climate Mayors.  This network of U.S. mayors — representing over 67 million Americans in red states and blue states — work together to strengthen local efforts for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting efforts for binding federal and global-level policy making.  Hundreds of US cities| universities| and businesses have declared “We Are Still In” regarding pursuing ambitious climate goals| and ensuring that the US remains a global leader in reducing emissions. This group is now working on the creation of “America’s Pledge|” an unprecedented effort to aggregate carbon reductions by cities| regions and businesses to ensure that the US achieves its Paris Agreement pledge."Chicago is a leading example of the growing impact cities are having on combatting climate change and reducing carbon emissions|" said Christiana Figueres| vice-chair of the Global Covenant of Mayors. "This Summit will provide an opportunity for mayors to continue acting on the political will demonstrated in Paris| showing that local action is being taken to fulfill commitments.

MacArthur Foundation have agreed to serve as initial supporters of the Summit.Mayor Emanuel also announced today that Chicago has reduced its carbon emissions by eleven percent from 2005 to 2015| bringing the city to forty percent of the way to meeting its Paris Climate Agreement goals.  The Mayor's June 7 Executive Order established the goal of reducing citywide greenhouse gas emissions to levels equivalent to or greater 26-28 percent reduction from 2005 levels to 2025| the original commitment made by the Obama Administration as part of the United States’ commitment to the Paris Accord.  The reduction in greenhouse gases over the past decade came while the number of jobs within the city increased by seven percent and is equivalent to shutting down a coal power plant for fourteen months.Today’s announcements build on Mayor Emanuel’s strong environmental track record since 2011. Mayor Emanuel has worked with cities around the country to post research from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Change Website after the Trump administration unceremoniously removed it from the federal government’s websites on April 29.  The research can be found on the City of Chicago’s “Climate Change is Real website| www.cityofchicago.org/climatechangeisreal. In April| the Mayor announced that by 2025 all of Chicago’s public buildings will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. That transition means that eight percent of the city-wide electricity load or 1.8 billion kilowatt hours will come from clean and renewable sources. This follows the 2013 commitment that the City made to eliminating coal from its electricity supply. Earlier this year| the City of Chicago was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2017 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award. The award is given annually to honor organizations that have made outstanding contributions to protecting the environment through energy efficiency and recognized the Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenge and its 76 member buildings covering 51.3 million square feet-all of which have committed to reducing their energy use by 20 percent.

666,Mayor Emanuel Announces Chicago Has Met 40 Percent of Paris Climate Agreement Commitments,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced that Chicago reduced its carbon emissions by 11 percent from 2005 to 2015| bringing the city to 40 percent of the way to meeting its Paris Climate Agreement goals.  The Mayor's June 7 Executive Order established the goal of reducing citywide greenhouse gas emissions to levels equivalent to or greater 26-28 percent reduction from 2005 levels to 2025| the original commitment made by the Obama Administration as part of the United States’ commitment to the Paris Accord.  The reduction in greenhouse gases over the past decade came while the number of jobs within the city increased by 7 percent and is equivalent to shutting down a coal power plant for 14 months. “While the current administration buries its head in the sand on climate change| it is now up to Chicago and other cities to develop a sustainable 21st century economy|” said Mayor Emanuel. “This report confirms that protecting the environment and growing jobs go hand in hand. This city| alongside numerous other cities across the country| is proud of its commitments to bringing down carbon emissions levels.”This final emissions inventory report analysis| developed by AECOM| found that Chicago generated 32.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2015| compared to 36.9 million in 2005.  The analysis focused on carbon emissions in major sectors| including stationary energy| transportation and waste| with significant reductions driven by a mix of reduced electricity consumption and the use of cleaner forms of energy. The report follows-up on the preliminary analysis from this January| which showed a 7 percent reduction in Chicago's carbon emissions from 2010 to 2015.  The preliminary and final reports can be found at www.CityofChicago.org/Emissions. “The emission reductions work being done in cities is critical to meeting 'America’s Pledge' -- our commitment to fulfilling the Paris Agreement|” said Mike Bloomberg| UN Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change. “Chicago is helping to lead the way| and I applaud Mayor Emanuel for the city's progress."This announcement builds on Mayor Emanuel environmental commitments through Retrofit Chicago| which comprises efficiencies made to buildings| streetlights and benchmarking goals.  Through the Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenge| 76 member buildings covering 51.3 million square feet have committed to reducing their energy use by 20 percent. Additionally| the City’s Energy Benchmarking Ordinance| which was implemented in 2012| has reduced energy use by four percent in buildings covered by the ordinance. Retrofit Chicago is a finalist for the C40 Cities Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards| which will take place in December. Earlier this year| Chicago was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2017 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award. The award is given annually to honor organizations that made outstanding contributions to protecting the environment through energy efficiency.The Mayor announced in April that by 2025 all of Chicago’s public buildings will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. That transition means that eight percent of the city-wide electricity load or 1.8 billion kilowatt hours will come from clean and renewable sources. This follows the 2013 commitment that the City made to eliminating coal from its electricity supply. In March| Mayor Emanuel| the Chicago Department of Transportation and the Chicago Infrastructure Trust announced the Chicago Smart Lighting Project which will replace 85 percent of Chicago’s light fixtures and add a management system that will give the city a state-of-the-art smart lighting grid. These new lights| which will be owned and operated by the City| will consume 50-75 percent less electricity than existing high pressure sodium lights| generating significant electricity cost savings that will be utilized to pay for the modernization.Since the Trump administration’s announcement to pull out of the Paris Agreements| cities across the country and the world have committed to creating a sustainable future for their residents. Mayor Emanuel joined over 300 Mayors from around the country to commit to the Paris Agreement as part of the Mayors National Climate Agenda| or Climate Mayors.  This network of U.S. mayors — representing over 56 million Americans in red states and blue states — work together to strengthen local efforts for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting efforts for binding federal and global-level policy making.  Mayor Emanuel also joined over 1|000 state| local| and business leaders from across the country as part of the “We’re Still In” campaign| coming together to signal the importance of the Paris Accord both nationally and across the world.Mayor Emanuel has worked with cities around the country to post research from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Change Website after the Trump administration unceremoniously removed it from the federal government’s websites on April 29.  The research can be found on the City of Chicago’s “Climate Change is Real website| www.cityofchicago.org/climatechangeisreal. ,September 18| 2017
667,Mayor Emanuel| City of Chicago Announce Legal Victory as Federal Judge Grants Nationwide Preliminary Injunction Against President Trump's New Conditions on Public Safety Grant Funding,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced that a federal judge granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against Attorney General Sessions because of new conditions the Trump Justice Department attempted to impose on the Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant| which provides critical public safety funding. The ruling was made in a federal lawsuit the City filed to prevent President Trump's Justice Department from requiring grantees to comply with unrelated and unlawful grant conditions that would have required Chicago to assist with Federal immigration enforcement. “Progress is never easy| but it is always worth fighting for. In Chicago we will always fight for our values and the rights of our residents|” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “Today’s ruling means essential resources for public safety in Chicago and across the country cannot come with unlawful strings attached from the Trump Justice Department. This is not just a victory for the City of Chicago| but a win for cities| counties and states across America.” In his ruling| U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber agreed with the City that the federal government has no authority to require the City to provide 48 hours advanced notice to the federal government before releasing a suspected undocumented immigrant from custody| and grant unlimited access to City lockups for federal immigration officials to interrogate suspected undocumented immigrants. The City’s legal briefs explained that the conditions are invalid and unconstitutional. The City also explained that the trust between immigrant communities and state and local governments would be irreparably harmed without a preliminary injunction| and that a nationwide injunction is necessary to protect all grant applicants from the invalid and unconstitutional conditions placed on the grant. “We are very pleased that the judge agreed that the Department of Justice does not have the authority to add requirements to a grant program that was created by Congress and has operated for many years under the established conditions|” said Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel. “We took this action to stand up for Chicago’s values and to ensure we did not lose important public safety grants by refusing to cooperate with these new unlawful conditions. This ruling makes clear that the Attorney General does not have the authority to unilaterally impose new requirements without approval from Congress.” Over the years| Chicago has used Byrne grant funds| in a number of ways to benefit public safety| including the purchase of SWAT equipment| police vehicles| radios and tasers. On August 31| the Chicago Police Department (CPD) submitted its application for FY2017 Byrne grant funding| making clear that the City will not agree to unlawful and unrelated new conditions attached to the federal grant application. CPD proposes using this grant funding to expand ShotSpotter gunfire detection| one of the key components of the new| strategically located nerve centers that help police get ahead of crime and prevent violence from happening in the first place.  This grant funding  would allow CPD to add an additional 20.31 square miles to the ShotSpotter network in Districts 003 and 004| two police districts experiencing higher than average rates of gang and gun related crime. “This Police Department is only as strong as the community’s belief in us|” said Acting Superintendent Kevin Navarro. “Every single day| CPD is building that trust through community policing and forging meaningful relationships with residents in every neighborhood. Regardless of who you are or where you are from| you will always have a right to be safe in Chicago.” The City of Chicago is supported in its legal efforts on this issue by two outside law firms| Riley Safer and Wilmer Hale who are providing their services pro bono.,September 15| 2017
668,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on Attorney General Lisa Madigan's Decision Not to Seek Another Term,"Lisa Madigan’s integrity| intelligence and unwavering commitment to justice made our state stronger and safer. Her service spans two decades and is one of many firsts. She is both the first female elected to serve as Attorney General of Illinois and the first Illinois Attorney General to argue a case before the Supreme Court in three decades. She never shied from criticism or shirked duty| earning her the esteem of colleagues| the respect of her critics and the admiration of the people of Illinois.

680,Mayors Emanuel| de Blasio| Garcetti| Kenney & Walsh File Another Legal Brief Against President Trump's Travel Ban,Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel| New York Mayor Bill de Blasio| Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti| Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh today announced the Cities of Chicago| New York City| Los Angeles| Philadelphia| Boston| 39 other cities and counties| the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities have filed another legal brief| this time in the United States Supreme Court| supporting legal challenges to President Donald Trump’s efforts to restrict travel to the United States from six majority-Muslim nations and to suspend the refugee program.“With his harmful| immoral and unlawful actions| President Trump has turned his back on the world and abandoned America’s values|” said Mayor Emanuel.  “Diversity is Chicago’s strength| and we will always welcome individuals and immigrants of every color| culture and creed. I am proud to stand with Mayors and municipalities from across the country in presenting a united legal argument to the Supreme Court to ensure that America’s beacon still burns brightly for all.”Today| Chicago led a total of 44 cities and counties| in addition to the U.S. Conference Mayors and the National League of Cities| in filing a friend-of-the-court (amicus) brief in support of the plaintiffs| the State of Hawaii| an immigrant rights group and several individuals who challenged two provisions of the Executive Order| both the President’s travel ban for individuals from certain Muslim-majority countries and the suspension of the admission of refugees into the United States.  Both the Fourth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals upheld preliminary injunctions against the Order. The U.S. Supreme Court has combined the cases and will hear oral argument in the consolidated case in October. “New York| alongside cities across the country| is again standing strong against the un-American| exclusionary policies of President Trump|” said Mayor de Blasio. “We are proud to embrace immigrant communities that are an essential part of our cities| where they help strengthen the local economy and contribute to civic life. This policy not only discriminates against immigrant communities| but also makes us all less safe by undermining trust with law enforcement and making immigrants more vulnerable to victimization. By targeting individuals from Muslim-majority nations| this order is also a refutation of our nation’s historic commitment to be a home of refuge for those fleeing violence. New York| in partnership with cities across America| will keep fighting misguided and dangerous policies that are an affront to our morals.”"The President's own statements make clear that this revised policy has little to do with public safety| and everything to do with his divisive political strategy| unlawfully aimed at one religious group|" said Mayor Kenney. "I am proud to join my fellow Mayors and other cities across the country in standing up for immigrants and their families|" said Mayor Walsh. "Together we are sending a clear message that preventing people from entering the country based solely on their faith runs counter to everything we stand for as Americans. Now is the time for us to reaffirm our values as a nation| and show that we will continue to be a country that will defend our most cherished principles.""The U.S. Conference of Mayors is proud to join with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and other mayors in challenging the President's travel ban|" said Conference of Mayors CEO and Executive Director Tom Cochran. "The Conference has strong policy opposing all forms of discrimination and hate speech based on an individual’s religion and country of origin| welcoming Muslims as U.S. residents| and supporting the U.S. refugee program. The President's Executive Order clearly discriminates against Muslims and refugees. The nation's mayors urge the Supreme Court to strike it down.""America's city leaders stand united against all exclusionary policies based on religion or national origin|" said Clarence E. Anthony| CEO and Executive Director of the National League of Cities. "Such orders undermine public trust in law enforcement and impact both tourism and workforce development. As city leaders| we welcome all those who dream of building new lives in our cities| towns and villages."In addition to the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities| Chicago| New York City| Los Angeles| Philadelphia and Boston| joined by Alexandria| Ann Arbor| Austin| Baltimore| Brighton| Carrboro| Central Falls| Cook County| Dayton| Denver| Durham| Evanston| Gary| Honolulu| Iowa City| Ithaca| Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer| Minneapolis| Madison| Montgomery County (Maryland)| Nashville| New Haven| New Orleans| Normal| Oakland| Portland| Providence| Rochester| Saint Paul| San Francisco| San Jose| Santa Clara County| Santa Monica| Seattle| Skokie| South Bend| Tucson| West Hollywood and West Sacramento| presented the local government position to the U. S. Supreme Court. The brief points out that President Trump claims unbridled and essentially unreviewable authority to exclude – on a blanket basis – hundreds of millions of Muslims from the United States just because they are Muslim.  His intent has been clear since the campaign| where he repeatedly promised to do just what he did in the travel ban.  The blatant discrimination against Muslims is a violation of our constitutional religious freedom and it is repugnant to the values our communities hold dear.The brief explains the vital contribution that immigrants make to our cities and country and argues that the travel ban is misguided and unconstitutional. Further| the brief argues that cities and counties serve as gateways for immigrants and refugees starting new lives in America| and that the President’s executive order endangers communities; undermines national security; limits the labor pool; decreases tax revenues; dampens tourism industries; and harms businesses| educational institutions and hospitals. Earlier this year| President Trump issued an executive order| followed by a revised executive order| restricting immigration by prohibiting people from six countries—Iran| Libya| Somalia| Sudan| Syria and Yemen—from entering the U.S. for 90 days and halting the admission into the United States of people granted refugee status for 120 days.Today’s filing is the fifth brief Chicago| New York| Los Angeles| Philadelphia| Boston and other cities and counties have filed against President Trump’s attempts to restrict travel into the United States. The City’s brief was prepared with the pro bono assistance of several attorneys of the law firm Riley Safer Holmes & Cancila LLP| which has offices in Chicago| New York and San Francisco.  The recent legal action is one of several actions the Emanuel Administration has taken since the November election to reiterate Chicago’s status as a welcoming City.Among these| to provide legal assistance to vulnerable Chicago residents| the city created a Legal Protection Fund| pledging $1.3 million to the fund to integrate legal support from attorneys with community navigators rooted in Chicago's many ethnic communities to provide outreach| education and assistance to immigrant families across Chicago.In August| Mayor Emanuel announced that the City of Chicago filed a federal lawsuit to prevent President Trump’s Justice Department from making a federal crime prevention grant that is critical to public safety efforts conditional on unrelated and unlawful immigration enforcement actions. As part of the suit| the City is asking the court to declare Attorney General Jeff Session’s actions in imposing new conditions to the FY2017 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program unlawful and that Chicago and its Welcoming City ordinance are in compliance with all valid and applicable federal laws. Earlier this week| Mayor Emanuel called on Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner and the Illinois General Assembly to establish an Illinois Dreamers Bill of Rights. The bill would enshrine protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) – also known as Dreamers – guaranteeing them access to state financial aid and scholarships| professional licenses and certifications for jobs and additional protections against deportation.Mayor Emanuel| U.S. Senator Dick Durbin and Congressman Luis Gutierrez also launched a new “Chicago is With You” task force that is collaborating on mental health| legal services| employer communications| and education policies to ensure the City is delivering comprehensive services to immigrants| refugees and other disenfranchised communities.Since taking office| Mayor Emanuel has launched a series of initiatives that improve the immigrant community’s access to services| expand new and existing immigrant businesses| and welcome and celebrate Chicago’s diverse immigrant communities. These initiatives include launching the Cities for Citizenship Campaign with the Mayors of New York City and Los Angeles| which has grown into a bipartisan effort which works with 30 city and county leaders across America.,September 8| 2017

TOTL recently completed its 65th season this summer and its fifth production with The Chicago Park District’s Night Out in the Parks. During construction| the TOTL Summer Festival was relocated to Berger Park Cultural Center. The Summer Festival will return to its home on the lakefront for the 2018 theater run and Isaac Gomez will continue in his second year as curator and director. The performance space will host productions throughout the year and will continue involvement as part of the Chicago Park District’s Night Out in the Parks series| which was launched in 2013 with support from Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE). This season| Night Out in the Parks hosted over 1|200 cultural events and programs in over 230 parks and in all 77 community areas.  "I am excited to curate the 66th season of Theater on the Lake and to be part of the first summer back in the space|” said curator| writer| dramaturg and working director Isaac Gomez. “Theater on the Lake is one of many venues that help showcase Chicago as the best theater city in this country."  The venue will host a range of private events| from large-scale benefits and galas to intimate gatherings and small dinners. The restaurant will be open to all for lunch and dinner daily and for weekend brunch. The indoor private venues have the capacity to host plated dinners for up to 500 attendees and receptions for up to 900 attendees. The Lakefront Restaurant patio| East Veranda and property lawns can host up to 1500 attendees. The facility will be available to rent beginning October 1. As part of the Chicago Shoreline Protection Project completed in 2016| Fullerton Revetment stabilized the shoreline along TOTL. The $31.5 million Shoreline Protection Project was funded by the Army Corps| the City of Chicago and the Chicago Park District. The total project included 1|700 feet of new revetment to manage overtopping wave flows| which created 5.8 acres of park space.  The renovation project is one of many public and private investments that support Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s Building on Burnham plan to invest in parks| the Lakefront| the Chicago River and other natural areas in neighborhoods across the city. This plan follows the Mayor’s successful expansion of Chicago’s park system and more than $800 million in capital investment from neighborhoods and private sources. Mayor Emanuel has made significant improvements to Chicago’s lakefront. The Trail Separation project will separate the entire 18-mile path for cyclists and pedestrians| and is expected to be complete in 2018. ,September 7| 2017
682,Various Measures Introduced to and Approved by the Chicago City Council,Below find press releases announcing various measures introduced to the Chicago City Council today.,September 6| 2017
683,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on Trump Administration's Decision to End DACA,"Amy and I have had the pleasure of hosting dreamers in our home for dinner. You can see in their eyes and hear in their voices how much it means to them to be part of the fabric of America. President Trump’s decision to end DACA is not only harmful to these young people| it strikes a blow against our core American values and is an affront to basic human decency. It is a betrayal of more than 800|000 children who have done nothing wrong and of the unique role the United States has played in the world for centuries. The United States is a nation of immigrants| not a country that tears families apart or deports children who have placed their faith in the promise of America. I know countless dreamers in Chicago who are talented| hard-working and dedicated to their families and the only home they have ever known. Not only will Chicago continue to welcome dreamers| we will pursue every legal option to protect our children| defend our immigrant communities and uphold the enduring promise of the American Dream.”,September 5| 2017
684,September is National Preparedness Month: Mayor Emanuel| City Officials Urge Residents to Plan for Emergencies Before They Happen,As the country recognizes National Preparedness Month in September| the City of Chicago is reminding residents to prepare for potential hazards and ensure readiness if a crisis occurs through a new #PrepareChicago campaign. Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced that throughout the month| the Office of Emergency Management and Communication (OEMC)| the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) and the Fire Department will conduct public education around emergency preparedness| including an advertising campaign providing tips for Chicagoans on how to prepare for large-scale emergencies and natural disasters in five languages. There is no known threat in Chicago| though the City recommends plan for the unexpected by making an emergency plan and building a kit of supplies| including for medical| financial and pet needs. It is also important to stay informed of ways to mitigate hazards and respond to emergencies| and to be aware of current events.  “Emergencies can come in many forms and we are taking the lessons learned from incidents around the country and around the world to inform our own public safety efforts and emergency plans. We urge individuals to do the same|" said Alicia Tate-Nadeau| OEMC’s Executive Director.  "We all have a part to play in planning| practicing and updating emergency responses and this is a good time for everyone to make sure they are ready should the unexpected happen.” Throughout the month of September| OEMC is making extra efforts to continue to provide readiness messaging throughout Chicago with outreach measures including speaking engagements| school events and social media.  We encourage everyone to utilize the emergency preparedness tools available at www.GearUpGetReady.org or www.Ready.gov as well as sign-up for emergency alerts at www.NotifyChicago.org. As part of National Preparedness Month|  CDPH is launching its #PrepareChicago public education campaign| providing tips for Chicagoans to prepare for large-scale emergencies and natural disasters. #PrepareChicago educates residents on how they can prepare their families| how to work together as a community and how they can volunteer during public health emergencies. “Chicago is best prepared when we are all prepared| which is why we are working to reach residents in every neighborhood in a variety of languages and formats|” said CDPH Commissioner Julie Morita| M.D. “Making sure all Chicagoans have the knowledge and resources they need to protect themselves in an emergency is imperative to our mission of ensuring the health and safety of our residents.” As part of CDPH's efforts to reach all Chicagoans where they live| work and play| emergency preparedness messages will be displayed throughout Chicago via the CTA and Metra transit systems| billboards| newspaper and social media ads. This year’s campaign also includes foreign language online and print publications as well as bus shelter ads in the five most commonly spoken languages in Chicago: English| Spanish| Polish| Chinese and Tagalog. Residents looking for additional ways to help can volunteer their skills by signing up for the Chicago Medical Reserve Corps (CMRC). CMRC has over 400 medical and non-medical professionals who assist in public health emergencies and local disasters. Chicagoans can sign up to volunteer online or via email at ChicagoMRC@cityofchicago.org.  For more information| visit www.CityOfChicago.org/HEALTH. Throughout the month| the Chicago Red Cross is partnering with the CFD and OEMC to install 2|000 lifesaving smoke alarms in high-risk neighborhoods. This is part of the American Red Cross’ “Sound the Alarm. Save a Life” campaign to install 100|000 free smoke alarms in cities across the country and educate residents about fire safety . “Being prepared means making sure your family is safe from the dangers that can be cause by fire and carbon monoxide|” said Fire Commissioner Santiago. “Make sure you have detectors for both smoke and carbon monoxide and that each unit has a fresh battery. The majority of deaths and injury from fire and carbon monoxide occur in homes that do not have working detectors. Make sure yours are working because your life may depend on it. And its the law in Chicago.” "Be sure your family is ready to help your pets in a disaster by preparing a disaster-preparedness kit and having it at the ready|” said Executive Director of Chicago Animal Care and Control Susan Russell "Your kit should include essential items like food and water for at least five days and a portable food and water bowl; your pet’s rabies| license and microchip information; any medications and medical records; current photographs of your pet; written information about your pet and veterinarian information; and a pop-up kennel.

685,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on DACA,“By intimidating immigrant communities and threatening to dismantle DACA| President Trump is threatening to violate the promise the United States' government made to these young people. DREAMers came out of the shadows and gave their names| addresses and phone numbers to the U.S. government. The idea that our government would use that information to go after them is unconscionable. Every day| DREAMers defend our nation in the military| attend our universities and contribute to communities across the country. Their patriotism and dreams cannot be measured by where they were born. Whether it is across the Rio Grande| over the Atlantic or up the Mississippi| we will continue embracing all those who chose to call Chicago home| and we will not stop fighting for the values that make this nation great. DREAMers upheld their end of the bargain| and this Administration better uphold America’s promise and ideals. It is time for President Trump to stop trying to tear down President Obama’s unifying agenda and more time trying to build his own.”,September 1| 2017
686,Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the Chicago Park District Open Landmark Event Space at the DuSable Museum of African American History,Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago Park District Superintendent Michael P. Kelly today opened the landmark outdoor event space at the DuSable Museum of African American History. Renovations were made to the 15|000 lot along the eastern edge of the historic Roundhouse building. “Since its founding in 1961 by Dr. Margaret Burroughs| the DuSable Museum has been a beacon of culture and history for Chicagoans and visitors from around the world|” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “This new outdoor space alongside Daniel Burnham’s Roundhouse building provides a one-of-a-kind destination for celebrations and special occasions on Chicago’s developing south side.” Renovations along the eastern edge of the Roundhouse building transformed an asphalt lot into a venue for private celebrations and special events in Washington Park. Construction included rebuilding the stairs at the Roundhouse basement| installing permeable pavers| landscaping| and building ornamental fencing along the south border.“As the nation’s oldest independent African American history museum| DuSable has always served as a gathering place for members of the community. This new event space will provide an additional venue for museum visitors and residents of our community – and indeed for the entire city of Chicago to celebrate on the south side|” said DuSable Museum of African American History President & CEO| Perri L. Irmer. “This project reinforces DuSable’s mission to promote understanding and inspire appreciation of the achievements of African Americans and the education of all people through black history| art and culture.”Funding was provided by the City of Chicago and the Chicago Park District. Renovations on the project began in July 2017. “The Chicago Park District is proud to work with the DuSable Museum and to transform a once vacant lot into a mainstay for the south side community|” said Chicago Park District Superintendent Michael P. Kelly. “The event space at DuSable is an unparalleled venue to celebrate special occasions in Washington Park.”This venue is one of many public and private investments that have strengthened Chicago’s south side under the Mayor Emanuel’s leadership| and include the XS Tennis Village in Washington Park and senior housing at the St. Edmunds Tower Annex. The City of Chicago and Chicago Public Schools made a significant investment to open Walter H. Dyett High School| a neighborhood high school focused on arts education that prepares students for college and careers. There have been significant improvements to public transportation and access to the lakefront on the south side. Mayor Emanuel recently opened the first section of the Lakefront Trail Separation project from 31st Street to 41st Street| and broke ground on the section from 41st Street to 55th Street. A replacement pedestrian bridge at 35th Street opened in 2016| and the second of five pedestrian and bike bridge projects is in construction at 41st Street over South Lake Shore Drive. CDOT is completing engineering plans for the replacement of the deteriorating| non-ADA compliant pedestrian bridge at 43rd Street. CTA also recently announced the renovation of the Garfield Station along the Green Line. The DuSable space is also a key component in Building on Burnham| the Mayor's comprehensive plan to invest in parks| the Lakefront| the Chicago River and other natural areas in neighborhoods across the city. This plan follows the Mayor’s successful expansion of Chicago’s park system and more than $800 million in capital investment from neighborhoods and private sources.DuSable and the City of Chicago have a longstanding partnership. The museum was the host site for elected officials| faith-based leaders| students| community organizers and residents from across the City to launch the One Chicago Campaign. The campaign is the visual depiction of Chicago’s value promise that everyone is welcome in this City no matter their race| religion| background or sexual orientation. DuSable will now host a Chicago Police Department for a cultural awareness training curriculum. As part of the Mayor’s commitment to police reform and as outlined in the Superintendent’s Next Steps for Reform released earlier this year| this is a demonstration of a commitment to comprehensive overhaul of training for new recruits that reflects the city’s values.,September 1| 2017
687,Mayor Emanuel Announces Amicus Briefs Have Been Filed in Support of Chicago's Lawsuit to Prevent President Trump's Justice Department from Making Federal Crime Prevention Grants Conditional on Unrelated Immigration Enforcement Actions,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced that a number of amicus briefs have been filed in support of Chicago’s lawsuit to prevent President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice (DOJ) from making a federal crime prevention grant that is critical to public safety efforts conditional on unrelated and unlawful immigration enforcement actions. The City of Chicago has applied for the FY2017 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program while making clear that the City will not agree to unlawful and unrelated new conditions attached to the federal grant by President Trump’s Justice Department.“We will not allow President Trump’s Justice Department to blackmail us into abandoning our values as a welcoming city| violating the Constitution or undercutting the Police Department’s community policing strategy|” said Mayor Emanuel. “The Trump Administration’s actions are flagrantly unlawful and unconstitutional| which is why a significant number of cities| municipalities| counties| mayors| law enforcement officials| prosecutors and advocacy organizations from across the country are standing with Chicago in this important legal fight.”A number of groups have filed amicus briefs| also known as friend of the court briefs| in support of Chicago’s lawsuit including:  37 cities| counties and municipalities across the country led by Santa Clara County| California and including New York City| Los Angeles and Philadelphia| in addition to the U.S. Conference of Mayors| the National League of Cities| the National Association of Counties| the International Municipal Lawyers Association| and the International City/County Management Association; a group of 23 current and former law enforcement officials and prosecutors from around the United States; Cook County| Illinois; Erie House; the Illinois Business Immigration Coalition; the National Immigrant Justice Center; and the California State Legislature.“The vast array of cities| counties| law enforcement officials and business interests that have filed amicus briefs in support of our lawsuit share more than our legal position| they share our values as a welcoming city and our dedication to community policing|” said Ed Siskel| Chicago Corporation Counsel.  “The Trump Justice Department immediately started to backtrack on these unlawful and unconstitutional conditions in response to our complaint| and we are confident that our legal efforts will prevent the DOJ from forcing us to choose between our values and important public safety funds.”Over the years| Chicago has used Byrne JAG funds in a number of ways to benefit public safety| including the purchase of SWAT equipment| police vehicles| radios and tasers. Yesterday| the Chicago Police Department submitted its application for FY2017 Byrne JAG grant funding| making clear that the City will not agree to unlawful and unrelated new conditions attached to the federal grant application. The Chicago Police Department (CPD) proposes using FY2017 JAG funding to expand ShotSpotter gunfire detection| one of the key components of the new| strategically located nerve centers that help police get ahead of crime and prevent violence from happening in the first place.  The funding in this grant would allow CPD to add an additional 20.31 square miles to the ShotSpotter network in Districts 003 and 004| two police districts experiencing higher than average rates of gang and gun related crime."The funds from the Byrne JAG grant will help us to expand the technology that has helped to significantly reduce gun violence in Chicago this year|" said First Deputy Police Superintendent Kevin Navarro.  "In order to sustain our progress| we need to expand our partnership with the communities we serve| that starts with building trust. Any obstacle to gaining that trust or the funds that will aid in our crime strategy will make it more difficult for Chicago police officers to do their jobs effectively and safely."Police nerve centers serve as dedicated intelligence hubs| where dedicated district leadership| crime analysts from CPD and the University of Chicago| and police officers monitor developments and gang conflicts in real-time| make fluid decisions regarding deployments| and allow CPD to make changes to their strategy as the situation dictates. The centers and its staff utilize historical crime data| input from ShotSpotter| video from pod cameras| and analyze them through HunchLab software to help police be more predictive| more proactive| and focus on the right people| at the right place| at the right time.  For officers in the field| they will be able to access real-time intelligence information and instant notifications from ShotSpotter through mobile phones equipped with the software. This technology allows police to have access to a wide range of information at their fingertips and significantly cut down response times to shooting incidents which can make the difference between life and death and can increase the chances of capturing an offender.On August 7| 2017| the City of Chicago filed a federal lawsuit against President Trump’s Justice Department for attaching unlawful and unconstitutional conditions to the FY2017 JAG application| including provisions to provide unlimited access to local police stations and law enforcement facilities by U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel to interrogate arrestees and the requirement that cities provide DHS with at least a 48 hour notice prior to an arrestee’s release| which would require detaining residents longer than is permissible under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. President Trump’s Justice Department filed its response to the lawsuit on August 24| 2017| in which the Administration announced that it was changing the conditions to avoid the Fourth Amendment problems identified by the City’s lawsuit. Further| the judge made it clear| and the DOJ agreed| that while this litigation is pending| the City would be able to submit the 2017 JAG application without certifying its compliance with these new| unlawful conditions. Yesterday| the City of Chicago filed the reply brief to support its motion for a preliminary injunction. Like the original lawsuit| the reply further establishes the reasons the DOJ’s conditions are invalid and unconstitutional; argues that the Byrne JAG statute contains no authorization for the conditions| and DOJ offers no authority for the conditions in the grant statute; and states that DOJ’s position also contradicts the Byrne JAG statute| which expressly restricts the Attorney General’s authority to limit Byrne JAG grant funds for specific purposes favored by the Attorney General. The reply also states that Chicago would be irreparably harmed without a preliminary injunction| and that a nationwide injunction is necessary to protect all Byrne JAG grant recipients across the country from the invalid and unconstitutional conditions placed on the grant.,September 1| 2017
688,Mayor Emanuel| Alderman Tunney Announce Plan to Change Time of the Cubs' September 8 Game,With the Chicago Cubs locked in a race for the National League Central Division Championship| and with a trip to the postseason on the line| Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Alderman Tom Tunney announced they have reached an agreement to move the team’s game against the Milwaukee Brewers on Friday| September 8 from 1:20 pm to 7:05 pm. The Brewers| who are in second place behind the Cubs in the division race| are scheduled to have Thursday| September 7 off while the Cubs play a night game in Pittsburgh before traveling back to Chicago for Friday’s game.  "The Cubs winning ballgames is a winner for the city too|” said Mayor Emanuel. “With the Cubs in the thick of the pennant race| we’re going to make sure the Cubs can focus on doing what they need to do: winning ballgames and bringing another World Series back to Chicago. I want to thank the Cubs organization for the professional and courteous manner in which they went about resolving this issue| as well as Alderman Tunney for his partnership.” “Night events have been an issue for many years for our neighbors and non-Cubs related businesses|” Ald. Tunney said. “I hope a one-time exemption of the Friday night game prohibition will further ensure a playoff berth for our Cubs.”Even after the change| the Cubs will remain below their annual limit of 47 night events. ,August 31| 2017
689,Mayor Emanuel Opens New CTA Train Station at Washington and Wabash,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today joined CTA President Dorval R. Carter| Jr. and CDOT Commissioner Rebekah Scheinfeld to open the new Washington/Wabash Station| a brand new gateway to Millennium Park and the east Loop| and the first new downtown ‘L’ station to open in 20 years. “The new CTA station at Washington and Wabash represents the best of Chicago’s heritage of architectural innovation and ingenuity while creating modern amenities for the thousands of travelers who utilize it every day|” Mayor Emanuel said. “We have made unprecedented investments to modernize transportation throughout Chicago| and this new station combines that commitment with our city’s culture.Built between Madison and Washington Streets| over Wabash Avenue| the $75 million station makes a bold architectural statement and replaces two stations that were built more than 120 years ago. The new station is first fully accessible for persons with disabilities with four elevators| an escalator and a platform that is wider than most others in the Loop.  The Washington/Wabash station sits steps from Millennium Park| historic Jeweler’s Row and the vibrant East Loop and Michigan Avenue. It is expected to become one of CTA’s top ten busiest rail stations| providing more than 10|000 rides on a daily basis on the Brown| Green| Orange| Pink and Purple Lines. The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) built the station| while working with its neighbors to minimize the disruption to Wabash Avenue merchants and traffic. The new station features a striking architectural “skeletal steel” canopy that provides extensive coverage of the station’s platform from end to end| and offers four elevators| an escalator and a platform that is wider than most others  in the Loop.  The station also has multiple surveillance cameras to enhance passenger safety as well as real-time train arrival information “This modern| bright and spacious rail station is another important step toward our goal of enhancing public transit options throughout the city|” CTA President Carter said. “We are delighted to have partnered with CDOT to create this fully accessible| architecturally significant new station that will serve Chicago and its visitors for decades to come.”“We particularly want to thank the impacted businesses| shoppers and residents for their patience during the construction project|” CDOT Commissioner Scheinfeld said. “We are proud to provide greatly improved access to the east side of the Loop for workers and students| residents| tourists and other users of the CTA system.”"This station will ensure people with disabilities will have an accessible stop on the east side of the Loop| opening new opportunities to access the city like never before|" Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities Commissioner Karen Tamley said. "It also brings us one step closer to creating 100 percent CTA rail station accessibility across the system and putting us even farther ahead of other legacy systems."The new station replaces stations at Madison/Wabash and Randolph/Wabash| both built in 1896. It will also improve travel time around the Loop for passengers and lower maintenance and operational costs for CTA. Additionally| the station was built to be sustainable| reusing existing structure| tracks and other elements and including the installation of bicycle racks to encourage alternative transportation as well as recycling bins on the platforms.The Washington/Wabash station also features a new public artwork created especially for the station by Chicago-based artist Michiko Itatani. Two large art glass panels located on both sides of the mezzanine – Cosmic Wanderlust 1 & 2 – reflect on human history and culture of the past| present and future. The artist’s multi-colored perspective of this theme features images of libraries| museums| public spaces and performance halls intermingled with images of the cosmos.  The $75 million new station was funded through federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program. Now that this station is open| the station just to the north| at Randolph and Wabash will be permanently closed on Sunday| Sept. 3. Demolition and removal will be completed before the end of 2017.The Washington/Wabash station is the latest in Mayor Emanuel and CTA’s $8 billion in transit improvement projects to build a 21st century| world-class transit system. Since Mayor Emanuel took office| the CTA has undertaken 46 station modernizations or comprehensive rehabilitations.Other investments in the downtown Loop area include the Quincy Station| one of CTA’s oldest and best-preserved stations that is currently undergoing a major renovation that includes the installation of elevators and other improvements. The downtown Loop Link| opened in 2015| provides dedicated traffic lanes for buses| bicycles| pedestrians and cars to improve traffic flow and decrease congestion in the busy area of Washington| Madison| Clinton and Canal. And in 2016| Mayor Emanuel opened the new Union Station Transit Center next to the Loop Link| serving six bus routes and providing convenient connections between buses| Amtrak and Metra trains.

690,Mayor Emanuel Celebrates the Opening of the Mildred I. Lavizzo Elementary School Playground,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today cut the ribbon at Chicago Public Schools’ (CPS) Mildred I. Lavizzo Elementary School playground. The renovation includes playground equipment designed for students ages 2-5 and 5-12| a permeable rubber surface for safety and meets ADA requirements for accessibility.  “On everything from playgrounds high-quality educational programming| the City of Chicago will continue making these important investments for our children’s future|” said Mayor Emanuel. “Lavizzo now has a high-quality place for students to play so that they can continue the remarkable academic successes they are making in the classroom.”In January 2017| Lavizzo Elementary announced the addition of IB programming| which enables students to more easily matriculate into the proven IB pathway for high school.

692,Citywide Mental Health Steering Committee Takes Steps on Police Reform| Mental Health Crisis Response,Mayor Emanuel today announced another step forward in the city's efforts to improve crisis response for individuals with mental illness as part of the city's ongoing police reform efforts that includes strengthening mental health crisis response. Over the last eight months| more than 500 community members in Austin| Garfield Park and North Lawndale have received free mental health awareness training to reduce stigma and provide information on emergency response resources. "Effective training is another a critical part of our continued police reform efforts and ensuring that the city is providing an effective and compassionate mental health emergency response|" said Mayor Emanuel. "Over the past year| the city has advanced mental health training that takes a holistic look at all aspects of the response. By not only training police officers and 911 dispatchers and call takers on effective emergency response| but also training the community on mental health symptoms and resources available| we can reduce stigma and better meet the needs of individuals who may be experiencing a mental health crisis.”The successful pilot trained more than 500 west side residents in awareness and identification of the signs and symptoms of a possible mental health crisis. In addition| residents learned about support services available from the City and community organizations| including the option to request a specially trained Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) trained police officer in the event of a crisis. "We know that individuals who have experienced trauma are more likely to face mental health challenges and engage in risky behaviors|" said Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner| Dr. Julie Morita. "The early results of our efforts of improving crisis response through trauma-informed practices show promise that with evidence-based training and interventions we are better able to identify| serve and ultimately treat those individuals with mental health challenges during a crisis." The pilot project grew out of Mayor Emanuel’s Citywide Mental Health Response Steering Committee| a coordinated effort to address how the city’s first responders can better serve individuals with mental illness. The goal was to free mental health training to 400 community members in partnership with schools| faith-based institutions and community organizations in the west site. “These results show evidence that this approach to addressing stigma and improving crisis response may be an effective way to engage communities in the solution.” said Kelly O’Brien| Executive Director for The Kennedy Forum| which advocates for ending stigma and discrimination against people dealing with mental health and addiction challenges. “We recommend that trainings be expanded to additional communities.” The University in Chicago (UIC) Jane Addams College of Social Work is spearheading an evaluation of the effectiveness of this training and presented an interim report to West Side Outreach Project organizers. UIC researchers confirmed that the preliminary results of the pilot show decreased stigma associated with mental health and addiction| increased knowledge and comfort in contacting a CIT trained police officer| increased knowledge about mental health and increased confidence that they could assist someone in need. Additionally| of the 296 people who participated in the study| a majority| approximately 70 percent| said that either they personally have| or a family member has| experienced mental health challenges. "These results are significant and indicate the community trainings are having an impact|" said Amy Watson| PhD| UIC Jane Addams College of Social Work faculty who led the evaluations. Trainings were offered to faith leaders| school staff and staff and volunteers from community based organizations. UIC led the pre-and-post evaluations of the effectiveness of the trainings| which were provided by Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago: Center for Childhood Resilience| Laynie Foundation| National Alliance for Mentally Ill (NAMI) Chicago| Presence Health| Sinai Health System: Under the Rainbow| Thresholds and Trilogy Behavioral Healthcare. The pilot is funded through the Chicago Department of Public Health.  "There are service calls that an officer may respond to involving individuals who are experiencing some type of mental health crisis|" said Police Deputy Superintendent Kevin Navarro. "Participating in this effort is part of our commitment to changing how we police in Chicago and making sure that individuals suffering from these crises receive treatment in a hospital and not a jail cell."The final report from UIC will be released early 2018 and will include additional findings to determine if the trainings resulted in referrals to community mental health services and increased requests for CIT trained officers in these communities. The Citywide Mental Health Response Steering Committee includes representatives from Mayor’s Office| Chicago Police Department| Office of Emergency Management and Communications (OEMC)| Chicago Fire Department| Chicago Department of Public Health| NAMI Chicago| The Kennedy Forum| Thresholds| Mount Sinai Health System and University of Illinois at Chicago. The Steering Committee continues to meet monthly to address its goals of improving training| increasing access to social services| reducing the stigma of mental health| educating the public on mental health first response| and collecting better data on outcomes.    West Side Outreach Project partners include: Advocate Health Care| Alderman Burnett| Alderman Ervin| Alderman Mitts| Alderman Scott| Alderman Taliaferro| Anixter Center| Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago: Center for Childhood Resilience| BBF Family Services| Bethany Fund| Blue Cross Blue Shield Illinois| Bobby E.

This has included training police officers and all OEMC 911 call takers and dispatchers in CIT and de-escalation. These efforts helped increase the number of CIT officers dispatched to mental health-related calls more than seven-fold over last year.

709,Mayor Emanuel Dedicates New Public Artwork Along Chicago Riverwalk,Mayor Rahm Emanuel| the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE) and Department of Fleet and Facility Management today joined local artist Candida Alvarez to dedicate four paintings displayed along the Chicago Riverwalk. These artworks| located east of Michigan Avenue| will be exhibited through December 2017.  “Art and cultural programming on the Riverwalk celebrates diverse artwork across all mediums and builds on Chicago's legacy of public art by enabling local artists to share their work with their neighbors and the world|” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel “In the Year of Public Art| patrons of the Riverwalk have a unique opportunity to see the world through the artists' eyes.” Emerging from a home life that immersed her in the traditions of her parents’ birthplace in Puerto Rico| Alvarez is known for paintings that combine the abstract and the representational - a major dialogue in current painting. Since 1998| Alvarez has been teaching painting and drawing at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Her work was recently featured in a solo exhibition at the Chicago Cultural Center. The paintings join other temporary installations of public art on the Chicago Riverwalk this summer.  Currently on display are artworks by Chicago artists Tony Tasset| Scott Reeder| Sam Kirk and Tyrue “Slang” Jones.  The Floating Museum is also currently on display along the Riverwalk| as part of a month-long tour at locations across Chicago. The Museum transforms an industrial barge into an aesthetically striking River Assembly exhibit – a mobile gallery and platform for public art and cultural programming. At each docking site| art crates are unloaded.

710,Mayor Emanuel| Department of Streets and Sanitation Tout Efficiency of Graffiti Removal,CHICAGO – Mayor Rahm Emanuel today joined Department of Streets and Sanitation (DSS) Commissioner Charles L. Williams to check in on the status of the City’s graffiti removal program. This year| Chicago has seen a 17 percent reduction in resident graffiti complaints over last year| which DSS attributes to swift graffiti removals under the grid model and additional resources like new blaster trucks. “Under the more efficient grid model powered by additional resources and crews| DSS has created a more efficient graffiti removal system - in many cases| graffiti is removed before residents even have a chance to report it|" said Mayor Emanuel. “From tree trimming| to snow plowing| to rodent abatement| and much more| Chicago continues to strengthen neighborhood services by getting work done more efficiently and more effectively."DSS uses a grid-based graffiti removal system| which enables crews to complete five wards every day. As compared to last year| DSS has reported 17 percent fewer graffiti removal calls. The Department has completed over 57|000 graffiti removals citywide so far this year and crews continue to respond to requests within five business days or less. Prior to the grid model| crews would respond to calls within 10 days. “The grid system has helped the Department improve its operations in everything from garbage to graffiti.  This system allows crews to quickly remove markings| which serves as a significant deterrent for future vandals|” said Commissioner Williams. "With Mayor Emanuel's constant support| we are able to try new strategies to ensure that we are providing the most competent and cost-effective services possible to our residents.” In May| DSS also announced that eight new chemical trucks had been added to the City’s graffiti removal fleet. The Department also redirected three new crews to help tackle graffiti thanks to efficiencies realized through grid refuse collection.Graffiti removal is a free service offered by the City of Chicago.  The graffiti program works with aldermen| community groups| block clubs| chambers of commerce and residents to respond to reports of graffiti.  Residents who would like to report graffiti can call 311| or visit www.cityofchicago.org/dss.,August 18| 2017
711,Mayor Emanuel Opens Phase II of the Northeast Cargo Development and Announces Record Cargo Activity at O'Hare,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today joined the Chicago Department of Aviation (CDA)| Aeroterm and cargo executives for the opening of the second phase of the $220 million northeast cargo development at O’Hare International Airport. The new cargo facility opens ahead of schedule in direct response to the strong demand for moving air cargo through Chicago to markets around the world. In just under a year| the partial completion of the northeast cargo development has already created approximately 600 permanent jobs| outpacing earlier projections it would create 1|200 jobs when the project is complete. With O’Hare’s newest cargo development on track and ahead of schedule| air cargo volume is already up by 15 percent over last year| putting Chicago on pace to handle 1.8 million tonnes in 2017. This marks another record year for cargo at O’Hare—one of the nation's premier cargo airports. “The City of Chicago is making investments and improvements to ensure O’Hare has not only the best commercial service| but the best cargo space|” said Mayor Emanuel. “With the next step of this project complete| we are delivering on our promise to grow O’Hare’s capacity and competitiveness| and in turn| its ability in the long-term to provide thousands of new jobs and serve as an economic driver for our city.” The Northeast Cargo development expands and enhances the efficiency of the airport’s cargo operations at no cost to Chicago taxpayers| funded by a $160 million investment by Aeroterm and more than $62 million of airport funds. The 240|000-square-foot Phase II building is home to Burak| Cargolux and Swissport tenant operators. When complete| it will be the largest airside cargo development built in the last decade at a U.S. international gateway airport. “O’Hare has long been a leading airport for air cargo| and thanks to Aeroterm’s development| Chicago is processing record cargo volumes|” said Ginger S. Evans| CDA Commissioner. “The opening of both Phases I and II of our northeast cargo development ahead of schedule is a testament to the strong demand and the fact that businesses around the world are continuing to choose Chicago O’Hare as their preferred North American gateway.” Keeping pace with Phases I and II of the northeast cargo development| and to support the record growth of air cargo| Phase III is now expected to open in 2-3 years| also ahead of schedule. In total| these investments will create an estimated 10|000 new construction and permanent jobs| as well as hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue for the City.  “There’s no better time to be investing in Chicago’s cargo operations| which is why Aeroterm is proud to partner with the City of Chicago as the developer of this major infrastructure project|” said Erin Gruver| Chief Development Officer| Aeroterm. “Not only will these investments our state of the art on-airport cargo warehousing support the rapid growth of cargo operations| but they will in turn improve efficiency of O’Hare’s airfield and facilitate healthy economic growth for years to come.” Expanding new cargo warehouse capacity provides O’Hare the ability to process a greater volume of air cargo in a number of ways. The addition of 747-8 capable aircraft ramps provides 50 percent additional capacity to handle cargo from jumbo jet freighters; and in its final form the northeast cargo development will deliver 800|000 square-feet of warehousing and apron pavement. These investments will make way for up to 15 wide body aircraft to unload at any given time at O’Hare. And with each jumbo jet freighter estimated to deliver cargo valued at $3 million on average| this is expected to drive hundreds of millions in economic benefit for the City and surrounding region. In addition to the new capacity afforded by the northeast cargo campus| Chicago’s surge in cargo activity is due in large part to its central geography and strong network of transportation infrastructure. Chicago has surpassed its large hub peer airports as the top destination for air trade with China| and trade with Asian countries continues to grow each year as new capacity becomes available at O’Hare. The northeast cargo development follows on a series of initiatives by the Emanuel Administration to invest in the modernization of O’Hare. The City recently announced the establishment of a new| uniform rate structure for aeronautical real estate leases at O’Hare International Airport that will generate $41 million in additional annual revenue for the City to invest in airport improvement projects at O’Hare. Also expected to expand capacity and establish modern facilities for O’Hare’s future is Mayor Emanuel’s O’Hare 21 vision—a multi-billion capital program designed to modernize terminals| expand gates| and improve connectivity at O'Hare. O'Hare 21 is expected to support tens of thousands of new jobs| add to incentives for companies to relocate| and further increase economic activity throughout the region.,August 17| 2017
712,Statement from Mayor Rahm Emanuel| CPS CEO Forrest Claypool and CPS Chief Education Officer Janice Jackson,“At the same time the President of the United States is throwing his arms around neo-Nazis and Klansmen| Governor Rauner’s brain trust at the Illinois Policy Institute weighed in on the SB1 debate by publishing an unambiguously racist cartoon. The critical debate over education funding in this state should be about ensuring a better future for students in every corner of Illinois| regardless of race| income or zip code – and not as an opportunity to divide us further. It’s particularly frustrating because CPS students are making historic academic gains. In fact| three CPS high schools were recently recognized among the top 10 in the country| and seven of the top 10 in the state. Over the past five years| virtually all of Illinois’ academic progress is attributable to Chicago’s students.,August 16| 2017
713,Mayor Emanuel Announces Decreasing Breast Health Disparities for Chicago's African American Women,Mayor Emanuel and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) today announced advances in breast health outcomes for African American women in Chicago. Chicago demonstrated the most progress in reducing racial disparities in breast cancer mortality compared to nine other cities with the largest African American population in the U.S.| according to a new study published in Cancer Causes & Control| an international journal of studies of cancer in human populations.“Chicago is showing the nation that when you work together to improve health| we can make a difference|” Mayor Emanuel said. “Even with this progress| there is more work to be done. Every woman regardless of race or income deserves access to life-saving prevention and treatment services and we will not stop until that goal is achieved.” Between 1999 and 2013| the mortality rate from breast cancer among African American women in Chicago decreased by 13.9%. The disparity between African American and white women has been reduced by more than 20% during the same time frame. “Alleviating structural inequity is a key component of Healthy Chicago 2.0|” said Chicago Department of Public Health| Julie Morita| M.D. “Identifying the obstacles faced by African American women and working to remove them is how we save lives.”To further closer this gap| CDPH is investing $700|000 in community partners to increase comprehensive breast health services for African American women and others who have faced historical obstacles to access. CDPH is partnering with Cook County Health and Hospital System| Rush University Medical Center| Mile Square Health Center of University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System| Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force (MBCTF)| Sinai Health System and Centro Comunitario Juan Diego to increase breast cancer screenings and ensure that high-risk| medically underserved women receive high quality follow up and treatment. These new investments help meet the goals outlined Healthy Chicago 2.0| the citywide health improvement plan| which includes increasing breast cancer screenings among older females by 5% and reducing breast cancer mortality among African Americans by 10%.Even with this progress| disparities remain as African American women in Chicago have a breast cancer mortality rate 50% higher than Non-Hispanic White women despite similar rates of diagnoses. Public health officials and community partners recognize that structural inequities may lead to minority and low-income women to receive lower quality mammography services resulting in later stage diagnosis and poorer prognosis.

716,Mayor Emanuel Opens Reconstructed Six-Way Interchange at Damen| Elston and Fullerton Avenues,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today cut the ribbon to open a reconstructed and modernized intersection at Damen| Elston and Fullerton Avenues| one of the city’s most congestion-plagued traffic hotspots. The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) project realigned the intersection by building a new section of Elston Avenue that connects to Fullerton Avenue east of the original intersection. The realignment allows southeast bound Elston traffic to avoid the Damen and Fullerton intersection| significantly reducing congestion.  “For decades the intersection at Damen| Elston and Fullerton has been one of the most dangerous and congested in Chicago|” Mayor Emanuel said. “This major project is a win-win| it has created jobs and economic opportunities across the city and delivered a fully rebuilt and redesigned intersection that is moving traffic more smoothly and safely.” The new stretch of Elston Avenue includes two through lanes for vehicle traffic and protected bike lanes in both directions. Improvements also included the resurfacing of all streets within the project limits| widening Damen to improve traffic flow and better accommodate bikes| and widening the north sidewalk along Fullerton. The project will include the planting of 162 new trees| with about 50 planted to date and the rest planted in the fall. “More than 70|000 vehicles pass through this intersection each day| and at peak travel times it used to cause major inconvenience for motorists as well as pedestrians and bicyclists|” CDOT Commissioner Rebekah Scheinfeld said. “We implemented a creative solution that has rerouted Elston and synchronized traffic signals to relieve congestion| improving safety for everyone who travels through the area.” The old section of Elston south of Fullerton was renamed N. Elston Court and has been reconstructed with access at Fullerton| and with traffic calming bumpouts at Winchester. The project also created space for commercial development on both the north side and the south side of Fullerton east of Damen.  The project was originally included in the North Branch North TIF Redevelopment Plan| to facilitate economic development. Several success stories are already evident from this improvement| including the adjacent $75 million renovation of the Midtown Athletic Club| which is completing construction of a new boutique hotel later this year. Vienna Beef was able to relocate its manufacturing facility and 250 jobs to another location in Chicago and is actively reconfiguring the use of the former plant to include retail and restaurant space. AndWhirlyBall| the popular entertainment complex| has relocated to a new facility in the area at Webster just east of Damen. “Completion of the Damen| Elston| Fullerton project is exciting news for the many Chicagoans who rely on our city's connected transportation system|" said Rep. Quigley. "The addition of a new traffic intersection| as well as safe| accessible  bike lanes| will reduce congestion and allow families to get from point A to point B quickly and efficiently. Forward-thinking improvements and investments like these will continue to strengthen our infrastructure and improve the lives of those who call Chicago home." The $22.5 million construction cost was paid for through federal| state| and local funds and was managed by CDOT in coordination with the Illinois Department of Transportation. You can follow CDOT on digital media:Twitter:  @ChicagoDOTFacebook: www.facebook.com/CDOTNewsThe web: chicagodot.org,August 14| 2017

718,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on the State Senate's Override of Governor Rauner's Education Funding Veto,“Governor Rauner's education funding veto brought together rural| suburban and urban educators and legislators in bipartisan opposition to the governor and in support of today's veto override. This diverse group of educators and leaders knows the Senate's education bill is right for Illinois children and the governor's veto is flat wrong. I want to thank Senate President Cullerton and the state Senators who voted on behalf of students and educators. The Senate's vote is a bipartisan rejection of the governor’s divisive politics and of his repeated attempts to pit children with different backgrounds and from different parts of the state against one another.” ,August 13| 2017

722,Mayor Emanuel and CPS Announce Record High Reading and Math Scores on National Exam,Mayor Emanuel| CPS CEO Forrest Claypool and CPS Chief Education Officer Dr. Janice K. Jackson today announced that more Chicago elementary students than ever before are meeting or exceeding standards for math and reading. For the fifth year in a row| CPS students have outscored national peers in both subjects.  A record 61.4 percent of students met or exceeded the national testing average in reading and 55.9 percent of students met or exceeded the average in math on the 2016-17 Northwest Evaluation Association Measures of Academic Progress (NWEA MAP) exam. NWEA MAP measured the academic achievement of more than 8 million students in grades 2 through 8 at more than 7|800 schools and districts across the country. “For the fifth year in a row| CPS students are meeting or beating the national average in both reading and math|” said Mayor Emanuel. “Record setting achievements like NWEA results are proof that when we raise the bar for Chicago’s students| they take pride in meeting and beating our expectations.” The percentage of CPS students meeting and exceeding the national average has increased by 34.6 percent in reading and 23.9 percent in math since 2013. With consistent gains over the past five years| CPS students are scoring higher in reading and math than their national peers. “Again| independent national data shows that Chicago students are learning and achieving at record breaking levels|” said CPS Chief Executive Officer Claypool. “By investing in schools and the resources our students need to be successful| CPS is working to put all of Chicago’s students on a path to success.” CPS students also continue to exceed national growth averages in reading and math. In 2017| 60.4 percent of students met or exceeded national averages for reading growth| and 56.7 percent of students met or exceeded averages for math growth. Any rate above 50 percent exceeds the national average for growth and signifies the substantial progress CPS students continue to make. “Chicago students have outscored their national peers for five years in a row| and we’re building on that momentum to make sure we are preparing every CPS student for success| “said CPS Chief Education Officer Jackson.  “Chicago students are breaking down barriers| changing mindsets and redefining what low income and students of color can accomplish when given the opportunity and support to succeed.”  At several CPS schools| more than 95 percent of students met or exceeded national averages in both reading and math. These schools included Lane Technical College Prep High School| Whitney M. Young Magnet High School| Annie Keller Regional Gifted Center| Skinner North Classical School| Decatur Classical Elementary School| James E. McDade Classical School| William Howard Taft High School| Kenwood Academy High School and Edison Regional Gifted Center. The NWEA results are only the latest example in several independently confirmed data points that show the tremendous improvements and remarkable achievements they are making. Most recently| a study from the University of Illinois – Chicago’s Center for Urban Education Leadership showed that Chicago students outperform their Illinois peers in every major racial and socioeconomic group.  This study came on the heels of research from Stanford University’s Sean Reardon| who found that Chicago students improve academically faster than any large urban school system in the country.  Since 2011| CPS students continue to make historic gains across a wide range of significant milestones such as “the Nation’s Report Card.” According to NAEP| CPS students were among the national leaders in gains for both eighth grade math and fourth grade reading on the national benchmark assessment in 2015.  Eighth grade CPS students achieved the greatest growth in the nation among their urban peers in math| registering growth of 6 scale-score points since 2013. Fourth graders achieved the third highest growth in the nation among their urban peers in reading with growth of 7 scale-score points since 2013. Chicago was one of only three urban districts – joining Cleveland and Miami-Dade – to have experienced academic growth in math and reading in both the fourth and eighth grades in 2015. Students have achieved historic gains in freshmen-on-track to graduate rates| as well as graduating high school and enrolling in college in record numbers.  The CPS graduation rate has climbed by more than 16 points since 2011 to 73.5 percent in 2016| and is growing more than three times faster than the national rate in the same time frame. In the same time frame| ACT scores have increased by 1.2 points across all district schools. Graduation rates have been driven in part by the district’s focus on its freshman on track to graduate rate| which was 87.4% in 2016 and up from 69% in 2011.  Mayor Emanuel and CPS continue to support student advancements by making significant investments to improve education. The transition in 2012 to the full school day and full school year ensured that students in all schools receive high levels of math and literacy instruction. CPS is also in the process of developing curriculum and sequencing for schools to adopt| expanding academic enrichment opportunities| like chess and debate| providing professional development opportunities and leveraging university partnerships to continue to implement evidence-based policies to put our students on the path to success.  Chicago Public Schools serves 381|000 students in 652 schools. It is the nation’s third-largest school district. ,August 10| 2017

729,Mayor Emanuel Announces Latest Efforts to Protect Southeast Side Residents from Manganese,Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) announced today that the City is expanding efforts to reduce manganese exposure to residents on the Southeast side. In order to hold producers accountable to the communities where they operate| a new study is investigating all companies who may use manganese and the impact to residents’ health in the area. The city is also increasing scrutiny of company manganese control and evaluating options for further action to those who violate local and federal standards. "Holding these companies accountable is about protecting the health of our children| our communities and our environment|" said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. "Just as we held petcoke handlers to high standards| we will ensure that companies either clean up or shut down."  The new study| conducted by a retained consultant| will include modeling of particulate matter| soil and air sampling near homes in the area and an assessment of the potential health risks to residents."Ensuring that residents are breathing clean air is our top priority|" said Chicago Department of Public Health| Commissioner Dr. Julie Morita. "We are committed to completing thorough and rigorous study so we are able to then make data-informed regulatory recommendations as needed."  In addition to CDPH’s routine inspections and continued monitoring for any off-site dust| the City will evaluate if increased dust control measures for bulk material handlers would lead to decreased manganese exposure for residents. The City will also begin increased inspections of S.H. Bell and other industrial sites on Chicago’s Southeast Side. "The people of the Southeast Side have a long and proud history. We will not allow any company| no matter how big| to put the health and safety of our community at risk|" said Alderman Garza| 10th ward. "We will continue to work together| with city leaders and community activists| to ensure our air| water and soil are clean." Manganese is a naturally occurring element that is used in steel production. Very small amounts can be found in soil| coal and other resources throughout the U.S. Manganese is an essential nutrient and intake from dietary sources such as whole grains and green leafy vegetables is necessary to maintain normal health. Direct| ongoing inhalation of large amounts of manganese can be hazardous. Chicago’s current bulk material regulations— for storage and handling—are among the strongest in the nation.  Presently| companies that manage bulk materials are required to have fugitive dust plans| which outline dust control measures| such as sprinklers and enclosures| as well as air monitors to ensure the measures are working. Today’s developments build upon the Mayor’s previous efforts to protect residents and the environment from harmful pollutants. In April 2014| the City Council of Chicago passed an ordinance to ban new petcoke| coke and coal facilities and prohibit the expansion of existing facilities.,August 7| 2017
730,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on the Passing of Don Baylor,“Today| baseball lost a genuine class act.

Baseball| and the world| has lost a respected clubhouse leader and an accomplished athlete with the rare distinction of playing in three consecutive World Series with three different teams. Amy and I send our prayers and condolences to the Baylor family.”,August 7| 2017
731,Mayor Emanuel| City of Chicago File Federal Lawsuit to Prevent President Trump's Justice Department from Making Federal Crime Prevention Grants Conditional on Unrelated Immigration Enforcement Actions,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced that the City of Chicago has filed a federal lawsuit to prevent President Donald Trump's Justice Department from making a federal crime prevention grant that is critical to public safety efforts conditional on unrelated and unlawful immigration enforcement actions. “Community policing is a guiding philosophy of the Chicago Police Department| but it cannot succeed when a segment of the community is afraid to cooperate or communicate with the police|” said Mayor Emanuel. “Chicago is a welcoming City and always will be| and we will not be blackmailed by President Trump's Justice Department. Forcing us to choose between our values and our Police Department’s philosophy of community policing is a false choice| and it is a choice that would ultimately undermine our public safety agenda.” Mayor Emanuel| Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel and Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson announced the City’s intent to file the lawsuit at a press conference yesterday; video of the press conference can be found at https://livestream.com/chicagosmayor/press/videos/160878814.

732,Mayor Emanuel| City of Chicago File Federal Lawsuit to Prevent President Trump's Justice Department from Making Federal Crime Prevention Grants Conditional on Unrelated Immigration Enforcement Actions,Mayor Rahm Emanuel| Chicago Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel and Chicago Police Department (CPD) Superintendent Eddie Johnson announced that on Monday the City of Chicago will file a federal lawsuit to prevent President Donald Trump's Justice Department from making a federal crime prevention grant that is critical to public safety efforts conditional on unrelated and unlawful immigration enforcement actions. “Chicago will not be blackmailed into changing our values| and we are and will remain a welcoming City|” said Mayor Emanuel. “The federal government should be working with cities to provide necessary resources to improve public safety| not concocting new schemes to reduce our crime fighting resources. The City of Chicago will continue to stand up to President Trump and his Justice Department to ensure that their misguided policies do not threaten the safety of our residents.” On Thursday| August 3| 2017| the U.S. Department of Justice published the application for FY2017 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program| which provides states and cities with federal funding to support local law enforcement efforts. Unlike previous applications| this year’s iteration requires that new conditions be met by local municipalities in order to be eligible for grant funding. These conditions include the certification of compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373| a federal statute that bars restrictions on federal-local sharing of immigration status information; unlimited access to local police stations and law enforcement facilities by U.S. Department of Homeland Security personnel to interrogate arrestees; and the requirement that cities provide DHS with at least a 48 hour notice prior to an arrestee’s release| which would require detaining residents longer than is permissible under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. These conditions effectively federalize local detention facilities and violate the Fourth Amendment in instances where detainees are otherwise lawfully eligible for release from police custody. Over the years| Chicago has used Byrne JAG funds for a variety of purposes that benefit public safety| including the purchase of SWAT equipment| police vehicles| radios and tasers. Last year| the City of Chicago received $2.3 million in Byrne JAG funds. As part of the suit| the City asks the court to declare the Attorney General’s actions in imposing the new conditions unlawful and that Chicago and its Welcoming City ordinance are in compliance with all valid and applicable federal laws. “We are filing this suit because the Attorney General does not have the authority to add these requirements to a grant program created by Congress and cannot commandeer local law enforcement to carry out federal immigration law functions|” said Corporation Counsel Siskel. “We are asking the court to ensure that we are not forced to either forego critical grant funds or agree to new conditions| which violate the Constitution and our Welcoming City ordinance.” Chicago’s Welcoming City ordinance prioritizes effective local law enforcement and crime prevention over federal civil immigration issues. This ordinance promotes public safety by ensuring that no city resident| regardless of their status| is afraid to cooperate with law enforcement| report criminal activity to the police| serve as a witness in court| or seek help as a victim of crime. “The federal government has been an effective partner in the crime fight| as funding and additional federal agents have greatly helped us to take guns off the streets and make our communities safer|” said Superintendent Johnson. "Removing those resources| regardless of the reason| makes CPD's mission to protect all residents in Chicago that much more difficult." Applications for FY2017 Byrne Grants are due on September 5| 2017. The Byrne JAG program is named for Edward Byrne| a New York City police officer who was murdered in 1988 while on assignment protecting a Guyanese immigrant who had reported illegal activity to police. The City of Chicago is being supported in its legal efforts on this issue by two outside law firms| Riley Safer and Wilmer Hale| who are providing their services pro bono.,August 6| 2017

From rodent baiting to graffiti removal to street sweeping| these are the resources residents want and need to maintain clean healthy neighborhoods|” Mayor Emanuel said. The Chicago street sweeping season runs each year from April through November.  So far this season| sweeping drivers have swept over 116|000 miles on our main and residential streets; over 2|700 alleys and have collected almost 63|000 cubic yards of debris.  The City also added 19 new sweepers to its fleet this season| which boast enhanced features such as improved fuel economy and better 360 degree visibility.  “The Department continually works to be more efficient and effective in the way we deliver resources to the community|” DSS Commissioner Williams said. “Street sweeping is a great example. It is an essential service that we provide to ensure that litter and debris is constantly swept and disposed of| making our roadways safe and passable| and keeping our neighborhoods cleaner.” Street sweepers sweep the main and residential streets to ensure that curb lanes are litter free. Sweeping also plays an important role in ensuring catch basins and viaducts are clutter-free| which helps prevent street flooding during major storms.  In 2017| milder conditions also allowed DSS to continue street cleaning along curb lanes| center lanes and viaducts during the winter months.   In January| DSS swept 4|359 miles| compared to the 275 miles in January 2016.  In February| DSS swept 6|044 miles compared to 1|548 miles in February 2016. DSS| along with the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT)| were in the area as part of a neighborhood service blitz. The blitz program began earlier this summer and delivers a targeted amount of resources to a community.    Crews have been out in the South Chicago neighborhood since Thursday cleaning vacant lots| addressing graffiti and rodent complaints| trimming trees| replacing broken street lights| filling potholes and more. As part of the blitz program| to date this year| City workers have filled more than 2|750 potholes; hauled away almost 2|500 bags of debris;  repaired or replaced more than 1|000 traffic and street signs;  graffiti blasted nearly 300 areas; replaced almost 150 burned-out streetlights| repainted 225 crosswalks| and towed over 100 abandoned cars.  The Neighborhood Blitz program will continue until the fall in neighborhoods throughout Chicago.   The street sweeping season will continue through November| weather permitting. To ensure curb-to-curb cleaning in neighborhoods| temporary parking restrictions are posted the day before sweeping is scheduled.  Some streets have permanently posted signs that outline days when parking is prohibited for street sweeping.  Residents should be mindful of all posted signage.  For more information| or to view the 2017 street sweeping schedule| visit www.cityofchicago.org/dss.,July 28| 2017
747,Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities Launches Task Force on Employment and Economic Opportunity for People with Disabilities,Mayor Emanuel and Commissioner of the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities Karen Tamley today launched a new task force focused on removing employment barriers for people with disabilities. The Task Force on Employment and Economic Opportunity for People with Disabilities will advise the city on relevant policies and programs in order to increase employment and economic development opportunities to benefit residents with disabilities. The task force launches on the 27th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)| which was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush on July 26| 1990.“Residents across Chicago deserve the necessary access to opportunities across the city|” said Mayor Emanuel. “While I am proud of the commitments and progress we have made for individuals with disabilities| there is more to be done. The Task Force on Employment and Economic Opportunity for People with Disabilities will help to ensure that individuals have an equal opportunity to earn a good wage and to live independently.” The Task Force brings together leaders of not-for-profit disability policy organizations| community- based service providers| universities and higher education to discuss the employment gap and economic growth opportunities in the region| and city and state. Leaders will work to advance policies and programs that better prepare students with disabilities for higher education; increase alignment on job training opportunities between employers and service providers; and encourage economic development through entrepreneurship. They will also review new and existing policies to ensure that the interests of people with disabilities are represented. "I understand the barriers Chicagoans with disabilities face to employment| and I am proud to convene this unparalleled group of leaders to address the very real employment gap|” said Commissioner of the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities Karen Tamley. “The Task Force on Employment and Economic Opportunity for People with Disabilities is uniquely qualified to address this issue head-on| and to ensure that residents are afforded the same opportunities to live| work and thrive across the city.”The Task Force was created by Mayor Rahm Emanuel| Commissioner Tamley and Alderman Roberto Maldonado to increase employment and economic development opportunities for people with disabilities. This is a critical step in being able to live independently| accessing quality education| job training| transportation| and housing. Creation of the task force delivers on the administration’s ongoing commitment to improving access and opportunity for disabled residents in a wide range of city initiatives| with a focus on education and employment. Under the Mayor’s leadership| MOPD has launched a number of initiatives focused on improving opportunities for people with disabilities to earn an education and gain employment. The City’s first Mayoral Literacy Task Force was launched in 2015 in an effort to close the gap in literacy and improve reading proficiency among students and residents with disabilities.The Task Force launches on the 27th Anniversary of the landmark civil rights legislation| The Americans with Disabilities Act. The ADA was signed into law| with the purpose of providing a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities. Since its inception| Chicago has been a long-term leader in disability rights with a robust community of actively engaged disability advocacy leaders and groups. While a series of both local and federal legislation| including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)| have contributed to significant improvements in quality of life in recent years| people with disabilities| who make up approximately one fifth of the population in Chicago| are still unemployed at higher rates and are more impacted by poverty than those without disabilities. Since 2011| the City of Chicago has installed over 91|000 ADA compliant curb ramps| provided disability accessibility at close to 70 percent of CTA stations| and has included the needs of people with disabilities into all city emergency plans. The city plans to strengthen access for individuals with disabilities in the areas of transportation| cultural institutions| education and employment. This includes plans to increase accessibility at CTA rail stations from 70 percent to 100 percent| additional access to fitness equipment at city parks| taxicab reforms and incentives to increase the number of accessible vehicles.,July 26| 2017

749,Statement on President Trump's Ban on Transgender People from Military Service,"On the 69th anniversary of President Truman’s order to integrate the military| President Trump has come down on the wrong side of history.

The intersection now has three lanes of traffic in each direction during rush hours| with curbside parking in some areas of the corridor during off-peak hours. The project also includes synchronized traffic signals to speed bus and vehicle traffic. The traffic signals are programmed for the new configuration and have the capacity to provide Transit Signal Priority for CTA buses| speeding up bus service. “We want to thank the residents and business owners of this community for their patience during construction|" said CDOT Commissioner Rebekah Scheinfeld. "The department took into account your input and the pedestrian bump-outs| wider sidewalks and landscaped medians were included with you in mind. Our hope is that it creates a safer environment and enhanced traffic flow while helping to improve the quality of life for the surrounding neighborhood.”   Pedestrian safety improvements include refuge islands| bump outs| high-visibility crosswalks| wider sidewalks| and the addition of pedestrian countdown signals at all signalized intersections.

Carter| Jr. said. “The new terminal will create jobs while complementing a 21st century rider experience.”The project will create the largest display of public artwork in CTA’s history. It is expected to create 10 jobs responsible for the production of the artwork| including an apprenticeship program for local students that will promote skills development and training. When completed it will be the 72nd art installation to go into a CTA station.The new works of art by Gates will be created in conjunction with the Rebuild Foundation and the University of Chicago’s Arts + Public Life program to incorporate job creation| skills training and significant engagement with local community residents.  The tapestries| named| “america america” are slated to be installed in the new south terminal building. The radio station and DJ booth| titled AESOP (An Extended Song of Our People)| will be located in the north terminal. As part of Mayor Emanuel’s “Red Ahead” program to revitalize the entire Red Line| CTA is replacing the cramped| outdated structure at 95th Street with a modern| airy and expanded terminal featuring a bold design. The new terminal will feature passenger structures on both the north and south sides of 95th Street| connected by an enclosed pedestrian walkway.Incorporating a bold red color on the station exterior| which will reflect the rail line it serves| the terminal will also feature expanded| covered bus bays and wider sidewalks to reduce congestion and improve pedestrian safety. The new structure also includes additional elevators and escalators.Funded by local| state and federal dollars| the project will be fully completed by the end of 2018. The new south terminal building will be completed before the new north terminal building. Theaster Gates is an internationally acclaimed artist whose practice includes object making as well as performance that engages critically with cultural history| contemporary socio-political currents| and community building. To more actively and directly connect with the communities central to his artistic output| Mr. Gates created the Arts + Public Life program and the Rebuild Foundation| nonprofit organizations that leverage art’s greatest asset—its ability to spark dialogue—to support| enliven| and revitalize underinvested neighborhoods. In 2012| the Wall Street Journal recognized Mr. Gates as Arts Innovator of the Year| and he was honored as the Commissioned Artist of the New York Armory Show and featured at Documenta (13)| the international art festival in Kassel| Germany.,July 12| 2017

Alberding| President of the Joyce Foundation. “We are proud that Chicago will be hosting Mayors from across North America and leading important conversations about local solutions to the threat of climate change.” “Leadership is the essential ingredient in combatting the effects of climate change|” said Julia Stasch| President of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. “As our national government turns its back on this critical global challenge| this summit is strong evidence that leadership increasingly is coming from local governments| along with states and the business community.” Since the Trump administration’s announcement to pull out of the Paris Agreements| cities across the United States and around of the world have shown their commitment to creating a truly sustainable future for their residents. Over the past several weeks| Mayor Emanuel has joined more than 270 Climate Mayors from cities across the United States in the commitment to adopt| honor and uphold the Paris Agreement. Hundreds of US cities| universities| and businesses have declared “We Are Still In” regarding pursuing ambitious climate goals| and ensuring that the US remains a global leader in reducing emissions. This group is now working on the creation of “America’s Pledge|” an unprecedented effort to aggregate carbon reductions by cities| regions and businesses to ensure that the US achieves its Paris Agreement pledge. In April| the Mayor announced that by 2025 all of Chicago’s public buildings will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. That transition means that eight percent of the city-wide electricity load or 1.8 billion kilowatt hours will come from clean and renewable sources. This follows the 2013 commitment that the City made to eliminating coal from its electricity supply. Earlier this year| the City of Chicago was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2017 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award. The award is given annually to honor organizations that have made outstanding contributions to protecting the environment through energy efficiency and recognized the Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenge and its 76 member buildings covering 51.3 million square feet-all of which have committed to reducing their energy use by 20 percent. The award also recognized the four years of successful implementation of the City’s Energy Benchmarking Ordinance which has reduced energy use by four percent in buildings covered by the ordinance. There are several city-based climate initiatives and organizations performing great work in North America and across the globe| which this convening will not aim to supplant or replicate. Rather| the convening creates an opportunity for those organizations and their members to come together for a single event| nearly two years after the signing of the Paris Agreement| to send a powerful message of the important of climate issues and a critical time| with the legacy work of the convening occurring through existing institutions. Climate change is not just an issue for megacities or cities on sea coasts. From extreme weather events to warmer temperatures to threats to water quality the impacts of climate change can be seen throughout America’s heartland| in cities of all size. The goal of the convening is to have a representative group of participating cities taking leadership on climate| regardless of population| political affiliation| or geography. Chicago’s leadership on the environment and convenient location and connectivity make it the most suitable choice. Additional details| including date and other events associated with the Summit| will be announced in the coming weeks.,June 21| 2017

The percentage of City Colleges STAR Scholars from the first 2015 cohort graduating in three years is expected to be double the national average of 22.6 percent. For first-time| full-time students at two-year public institutions nationwide who complete in three years (National Student Clearinghouse Research Center| March 2017)| and the percentage of Star Scholars graduating in two years has already nearly matched the national three-year rate.   Of those STAR Scholars projected to graduate this year| more than 70 percent are in the first-generation of their family to attend college.   To become a STAR Scholar| CPS students must meet specific criteria to be selected for the STAR Scholarship at City Colleges of Chicago. These students must graduate with a GPA of 3.0 or higher| they must demonstrate “completion ready” ability with an ACT math and English score of 17| and they must enroll in one of CCC’s structured| relevant pathways.

818,Statement from Mayor Emanuel on Paris Accord,"The President’s decision to pull out of the Paris Accord is a poor attempt to pit environmental protection and economic growth against each other. It’s a false choice. Chicago has proven you can create jobs while reducing your carbon footprint| and we will continue to do both. As the Trump administration pulls back we will push forward and reduce our fair share of carbon emissions in line with the Paris Accord. The world is depending on cities in the US to take up the mantle of leadership on climate change. Chicago will happily accept that challenge."In January Mayor Emanuel announced that Chicago has reduced its carbon emissions by 7% from 2010 to 2015| according to a new analysis. This reduction in greenhouse gases came at the same time Chicago saw a 25|000 person increase in its population and 12 percent growth in the region’s economy and jobs within the city. The emissions reduction| equivalent to shutting down a coal power plant for 8 months| compares to a 1 percentage increase in nationwide emissions from 2009 to 2014.The preliminary analysis| developed by AECOM| and the first 2015 emissions inventory for any major North America city| estimated Chicago generated 30.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2015| compared to 33.3 million in 2010.

823,Mayor Emanuel Announces Teen Birthrate at Historic Low,Mayor Emanuel and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) today announced teen births are at a historic low in Chicago. This milestone comes after eight consecutive years of decline. In 2014| the most recent year for which data is available| there were 32 births per 1|000 females aged 15-19 years old| more than a 62 percent drop from the 85.2 rate in 1999. Even though Chicago’s teen birth rate is higher than the national average| which is also dropping| that gap is closing as Chicago’s teen birthrate has dropped 20 percent more than national rates.   “This is an important step in the right direction as Chicago continues to work towards fewer teen births|” Mayor Emanuel said. “Every teen in this city deserves resources and education so they can make informed choices.” While Chicago has seen declines in teen births across all racial and ethnic groups since 2010| African American teens have seen the most compelling decline during that time| from more than 72 births per 1|000 females to just 41| which represents a 44 percent drop overall.“These historic declines are good news for babies| teens and Chicago|” said CDPH Commissioner Julie Morita| M.D. “By providing teens with resources| information and support they need| we can drive these numbers down even further| ensuring every teenager has a chance to be teenager.”  Becoming pregnant early in life can lead to challenges for birth parents and their children. Studies show that approximately 38 percent of teen mothers earn a high school diploma| and less than 2 percent earn a college degree by the age of 30. Children born to teen mothers are also 50 percent more likely to repeat a grade and are less likely to complete high school than children of older mothers.  "We know that delaying parenthood beyond the teen years helps keep young people in school|" said CPS Office of Student Health and Wellness Chief Health Officer Kenneth Fox| M.D. "The CPS comprehensive Sexual Health & Wellness curriculum is vital to those efforts. When teens reach important educational milestones like graduation| they benefit from increased opportunities for themselves and their families."   Despite this good news| disparities persist at both the local and national levels in the rates of teen births and other sexual health outcomes| like sexually transmitted infections. CDPH has launched a comprehensive effort to further reduce the teen birth rate and promote equity for youth sexual and reproductive health in Chicago. ,May 28| 2017

Treatment among individuals living with HIV is a key strategy in CDPH’s prevention model along with Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)| a daily pill that helps prevent HIV. In addition to HIV primary care services| each clinic offers early intervention services to ensure patients are quickly linked and retained in care| mental health and medical case management services. These partnerships are part of a comprehensive citywide plan to ensure those living with HIV receive the care they need and to reduce the number of new transmissions of HIV.  According to the 2016 HIV/STI Surveillance Report| 79 percent of Chicago residents newly diagnosed with HIV were linked to medical care| like what is offered at these clinics| within one month of diagnosis. Within 12 months of diagnosis| 90 percent of individuals had been linked to medical care| placing Chicago well ahead of national rates.  Over the last decade| Chicago has seen a steady overall decline in new HIV diagnoses however| in 2015 Englewood and Uptown had some of the highest HIV diagnoses rates and Uptown also has one of the highest rates of people living with HIV. CDPH maintains HIV primary care services in these areas to ensure that residents can access the quality care they need to keep themselves healthy and continues to use data to strategically increase accessibility to resources and care and promote health equity citywide.  “More people are living and thriving with HIV in Chicago than ever before|” added Commissioner Morita. “We will continue to invest available resources to provide quality care and ultimately bring this epidemic to an end.” For more information on the Primary Care clinics please visit www.cityofchicago.org/health.,May 20| 2017

838,Mayor Emanuel Announces Chicago Plan Commission Passage of Innovative Framework to Guide Future North Branch Development,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced the Chicago Plan Commission’s unanimous approval of the North Branch Industrial Corridor Framework. The plan is expected to generate billions of dollars in private community investment| hundreds of millions of dollars in new tax revenues| and tens of thousands of jobs benefitting the entire City of Chicago. The plan is designed to generate significant resources to support commercial projects and economic opportunities in neighborhoods that need investment.“This plan represents countless hours of community input and thoughtful planning designed to balance the needs of community members and local businesses while paving the way to a bright future for the north branch industrial corridor|” Mayor Emanuel said. “In addition to building a new future for the north branch area| this framework will also generate revenue from this thriving area to support industrial businesses throughout Chicago. Now we move forward to the next step in the process| which will bring together the north branch stakeholders to turn this plan into concrete progress for the community.”Through a public engagement process that began in the spring of 2016 and included more than 800 participants and 18 community meetings| the North Branch Framework identifies new land use parameters| transportation improvements and open space amenities for 760 acres of land along the Chicago River between Kinzie Street and Fullerton Avenue. With goals to maintain the North Branch as an important economic engine and vital job center; provide better access for all transportation modes; and build upon the corridor’s unique natural and built environment| the Framework’s 19 specific planning recommendations could eventually triple the local employment base| create more than 60 acres of public open space| and bring more than a dozen multi-modal transportation enhancements to an area that hadn’t been formally reviewed for comprehensive land use improvements in nearly three decades.As the first phase of Mayor Emanuel’s Industrial Corridor Modernization Initiative that will expand to the city’s 25 other designated industrial corridors in coming months| the Framework’s adoption by Plan Commission will serve as a guide to assess future development projects and infrastructure improvements within corridor boundaries. Specific zoning and related implementation goals involving the plan and future development projects will require additional Plan Commission and City Council approval.“The community engagement for the Framework identified often competing needs that the plan successfully balances on behalf of the area and the entire city|” Department of Planning and Development Commissioner David L. Reifman said. “The Framework takes a sustainable approach to all the input we received| from zoning to traffic to open space.”Historically the home of heavy manufacturing and related uses| the North Branch corridor currently supports approximately 15|000 jobs| including thousands of business services| technology| and business management positions that have exponentially increased since 2002. Over the same period| the corridor’s manufacturing workforce simultaneously decreased by 40 percent to 1|500 jobs| resulting in several large tracts of vacant land within the corridor."The redevelopment plan will support job growth| infrastructure investment| economic development and new revenue|” Theresa E. Mintle| President & CEO of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce said. “It's a win-win for the community| business and the City|" “This plan will leverage a historic modernization of one part of Chicago and make it benefit the entire city|” Ald. Walter Burnett said. “I look forward to seeing the new affordable housing and job opportunities that will be part of this revitalization.”“This framework is the culmination of an inclusive| transparent process fueled by the interests of impacted residents| community stakeholders and the City’s planning experts|” Ald. Brian Hopkins said. “I’m committed to delivering on the framework’s recommendations that include existing infrastructure upgrades| additional transit options| and opportunities to add significant recreational open space| which will ultimately yield lasting benefits for the community.”The Framework’s land use recommendations respond to market demands for a dynamic mix of uses| along with appropriate transportation and open space enhancements that support its viability for future businesses| workers| residents and visitors.“When implemented| the framework could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new public and private corridor investments that would generate tens of thousands of construction| manufacturing| retail and service sector jobs|” Jorge Ramirez| President of Chicago Federation of Labor said. “These are working families that will use their hard-earned money to spend and invest in the communities in which they live.”The Framework also includes implementation strategies that will fund local and citywide improvements| as well as design guidelines that will help maintain the corridor’s uniquely urban character.Major planning principles include:LAND USE•    Target more than 50 percent of corridor land for employment purposes•    Allow new mixed-use development at appropriate locations with provisions for affordable housing and publicly accessible open space•    Increase allowable density and height while creating high-quality publicly accessible open spaces and non-vehicular transportation improvements•    Encourage new uses at the bases of buildings along the river to encourage public activitiesTRANSPORTATION•    Reconfigure roadways| viaducts| and bridge reconstruction projects to help manage traffic circulation•    Build a dozen new pedestrian/bike bridges and under-bridge connections along the river to increase the effectiveness of the area’s five transit stations•    Extend the 606 multi-purpose path over the river•    Leverage technologies like “smart signals” and real-time displays to minimize peak travel times•    Study a dedicated public transit-way on existing rail corridors and other rights-of-wayOPEN SPACE•    Build 32 acres of linear park space as part of a new| seven-mile river trail| consistent with Mayor Emanuel’s vision of enhancing the river as Chicago’s next recreational frontier•    Incorporate at least 10 acres of new publicly accessible open spaces for sports and recreational fields•    Add a one-acre park as part of a 606 connection with the river trail•    Create 17 acres of wetland parksIMPLEMENTATIONAs adopted by Plan Commission| the Framework will be used by the City Council to consider initial zoning changes that accommodate necessary land use transitions in the North Branch area. The City Council will also consider Planned Developments (PD) and other zoning changes proposed by private developers and property owners. Initial zoning recommendations seek to:•    Change existing Planned Manufacturing District (PMD) zoning in the north portion of the corridor to Manufacturing (M)| which would permit existing uses and accommodate transitions to mixed-use office| commercial and residential uses at appropriate locations.•    Maintain and refine existing Planned Manufacturing District (PMD) zoning in the central portion of the corridor| largely around Goose Island.•    Change existing Planned Manufacturing District (PMD) zoning in the southern portion of the corridor to Downtown Service (DS)| which would permit existing uses and accommodate transitions to downtown-type mixed-use commercial and residential uses nearby. •    Establish an overlay district and other land use parameters that identify buffer areas| use restrictions| and density regulations to ensure new development projects enhance the corridor’s overall development patterns and function.FUNDING APPROACHThe plan recommends several new and existing funding tools to finance proposed improvements within the corridor as well as other parts of the city:•    A new Industrial Corridor System Fee would apply to projects in the North Branch and other corridors that are transitioning from PMD/manufacturing to other uses| triggered by private applications for a zoning change away from industrial zoning. Similar to the way Mayor Emanuel has successfully leveraged resources with the new Neighborhood Opportunity Fund| redevelopment within the North Branch could generate tens of millions of new revenues to support industrial improvement projects in other industrial corridors throughout the city.•    Application of the existing downtown Zoning Bonus system for the southern portion of the corridor| available through a change to Downtown (DX) mixed-use zoning| will result in tens of millions of additional dollars for the Mayor’s Neighborhood Opportunity Fund| to invest in commercial development on the city’s South and West Sides.•    A new Zoning Bonus system in the northern portion of the corridor would enable new projects to seek increased density through a voluntary payment. The payment would primarily support local improvements within the North Branch area| as well as contribute to vital projects in industrial corridors throughout other parts of the city.•    Planned Development (PD) contributions that would provide or contribute to publicly accessible open space| river walks| traffic signals| roads| and other infrastructure costs.•    Other city| state and federal sources.A complete copy of the plan and more information about Mayor Emanuel’s Industrial Corridor Modernization Initiative are available at the DPD web site at www.cityofchicago.org/dpd.,May 18| 2017

841,Mayor Emanuel Joins Illinois Municipal Leaders Urging Governor and State Lawmakers to Pass a Budget Without Shifting Burden to Local Taxpayers,CHICAGO – Mayor Rahm Emanuel today joined a bipartisan group of local leaders from across the greater Chicagoland area in urging Governor Rauner and state lawmakers to pass a budget without putting the burden on local governments by reducing the local share of the Local Government Distributive Fund (LGDF).  “Too often the budget debate in Springfield is viewed as something abstract| or a partisan battle of attrition|” Mayor Emanuel said. “As leaders at the local level who must address problems despite the state’s funding shortfalls and bill backlogs| we know full well this is neither an abstraction nor an opportunity for partisan gain – it’s a matter of doing the right thing for people all across Illinois. Local governments throughout the state already are stretched to the brink| and cannot afford careless cuts to the LGDF.” Local governments receive a portion of state income taxes| which is distributed through the LGDF. Reducing the local share of LGDF would result in far fewer resources available to provide public safety| economic development| transportation and housing for residents in towns| cities and villages across the greater Chicago region.  “The Mayors Caucus sees the state’s finances at a critical point and action is needed now to keep us from irreparable damage|” said Robert Nunamaker| President of Village of Fox River Grove and Chairman of the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus.View the letter signed by local leaders representing 275 cities| towns| and other municipalities across the greater Chicagoland area.,May 17| 2017

843,Lakefront Trail Separation Construction Continues from Fullerton to North Avenues and from Oak to Ohio Streets,Mayor Rahm Emanuel| Chicago Park District Superintendent Michael P. Kelly and Kenneth Griffin today gathered to break ground on the next segments of the Lakefront Trail Separation project to separate bike and pedestrian paths. Construction will begin from Fullerton to North Avenues and from Oak to Ohio Streets. This project is made possible by a generous gift from Kenneth Griffin.“This is an important next step in continued efforts to make the Lakefront Trail safer and more accessible for the thousands of cyclists| runners and walkers that use the path each day|” Mayor Emanuel said. “Trail separation does more than address issues of overcrowding; it builds a better future for one of the city’s greatest assets by ensuring Chicagoans and visitors are able to experience what the lakefront has to offer.”The Lakefront Trail Separation was designed to alleviate areas of congestion by creating two distinct paths; a bike trail and a separate pedestrian trail for those on foot. Mayor Emanuel originally announced plans to separate the trail from Fullerton to Ohio streets and 31st to 51st streets when he unveiled Building on Burnham| a comprehensive vision to invest in Chicago's parks and open spaces.“I am excited to see us taking another step forward towards making the Lakefront trail safer and more enjoyable for everyone in Chicago|” said Kenneth Griffin. “I appreciate all of the efforts that have gone into this great project and applaud Mayor Emanuel and Superintendent Kelly for their continued leadership.”Once complete| the split trail will provide separate paths for cyclists and pedestrians along the entire 18-mile pathway. The commuter trail| made of asphalt| will measure 12 feet in width and will be located closest to Lake Shore Drive. The pedestrian trail will measure 20 feet in width with 14 feet of asphalt and 6 feet of soft surface mix on either side."We have worked collectively with the City of Chicago| Active Transportation Alliance and Chicago Area Runners Association for years in search of ways to enhance the lakefront trail experience|" said General Superintendent and CEO Michael P. Kelly. "We are fortunate to have the support of Mr. Griffin to bring the trail separation project to fruition."Starting May 22| the Lakefront Trail will be closed east of Lake Shore Drive between Diversey and North Avenues for construction. Trail separation construction will take place from Oak to Ohio Streets| and space will be provided in a shared lane around active construction. Due to limitations on space in this section of the trail| the contractor will make every effort to limit the use of heavy equipment during busy morning and evening traffic.  A marked detour route west of Lake Shore Drive will be available to Lakefront Trail users. Trail users can access construction information and detour maps by checking www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/lakefront-trail/ or following us on Facebook and Twitter construction updates. ,May 13| 2017

The results build on Chicago’s record performance in 2016| when 54.1 million people visited Chicago. The results also bring the city even closer to reaching the Mayor's goal of 55 million visitors annually by 2020."Tourism creates jobs that reach every part of the city of Chicago|” Mayor Emanuel said. "We had a record-breaking year in 2016| and this year is off to a record-breaking start. This progress will ensure that we continue to create economic opportunities across Chicago and grow even closer to my goal of 55 million visitors by 2020.”In the first quarter of 2017| total rooms occupied reached a record 2.12 million| an increase of 5.9 percent. The occupancy rate increased by 2.6 percent to 58 percent| and leisure room demand achieved a record 1.52 million rooms occupied in the quarter| a gain of 4.4 percent. Fourteen out of the last 15 months have now seen leisure room demand growth. Group room demand grew 10 percent| which was driven by nine major meetings convening in Chicago in the first quarter| filling more than 550|000 rooms. “We are thrilled to see the momentum generated last year continue through the first quarter|" Whitaker said. "Chicago continues to excel as a major meetings destination and the growth in leisure demand signals our continued success and reputation as a destination that features amazing vacation and lifestyle experiences."Chicago welcomed a record 52.55 million domestic visitors and an estimated 1.56 million overseas visitors in 2016.

852,Mayor Emanuel Announces Major Increase in Wheelchair-Accessible Transit Options for Residents and Visitors Throughout Chicago,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced a major increase in the availability of wheelchair-accessible transit options for Chicago residents and visitors. Since the Mayor took office| the city has tripled the number Wheelchair Accessible Vehicles (WAVs) from 91 to 298| with 130 WAV taxicabs added since January 1| 2016. This progress keeps the city on track to reach the Emanuel Administration’s goal of 400 wheelchair-accessible taxicabs in 2018.  To keep the progress going| the Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP) has approved plans from Uber| Lyft and VIA to enhance service to customers with disabilities. Under the plans| the transportation network providers (TNPs| also known as rideshares) will bring an additional 50 wheelchair-accessible vehicles online and available to Chicago’s residents and visitors within the next six months.“Every Chicagoan deserves access to safe| reliable transit|” Mayor Emanuel said. “Major innovations are taking place in the public passenger vehicle and transportation network provider industries| and the city of Chicago recognizes the hard work of industry| advocates and aldermen to make this a reality.”The City’s Accessibility Fund| which is supported by fees paid by the taxi and TNP industries| has driven much of the progress seen to date. In 2012| the city of Chicago began offering a $15|000-$20|000 incentive to convert a vehicle to a WAV taxicab or purchase a factory-built WAV taxicab to increase the number of wheelchair-accessible taxicabs in Chicago. In 2016| the city of Chicago created new incentives| including: (1) an elimination of a fee charged to Wheelchair-Accessible Vehicle (WAV) medallion holders for dispatch service| (2) a $10|000 “early bird” incentive to medallion owners that purchased WAV taxicabs in 2016| and (3) up to $5|000 in an annual grant for WAV taxicab owners for vehicle maintenance| among others.Due to reforms enacted as part of Mayor Emanuel’s 2016 budget| the City’s Accessibility Fund receives approximately $6.5 million annually to fully support the Administration’s accessibility goals. In 2017 alone| BACP has already disbursed more than $1.5 million year-to-date in these funds to support an increase in wheelchair-accessible vehicle options. This has supported 45 WAV taxicab conversions| the purchase of 18 new factory-built WAV taxicabs| 50 “early bird” incentives for WAV taxicabs purchased in 2016| and maintenance on 37 WAV taxicabs. Since Mayor Emanuel took office| the number of WAV taxicabs operating in Chicago has increased from 91 to 298| more than tripling the total number in the city’s fleet.In June 2016| Chicago City Council passed reforms that required TNPs to submit plans to enhance service to customers with disabilities. In January 2017| Uber| Lyft and VIA submitted their plans for review| which have now been approved by BACP in consultation with MOPD. The companies now have six months to implement them. The city will re-evaluate the plans on an ongoing basis to ensure that customer demand is met going forward.Using these companies’ apps| residents will soon be able to secure rides from additional wheelchair-accessible vehicles that will be brought online and more efficiently connect to the city’s nearly 300 existing available WAV taxicabs. The addition of 50 wheelchair-accessible vehicles over the next six months by the TNP industry mirrors the rate at which WAV taxicabs were being added to the city’s fleet as of early 2017.“The Mayor’s hard work to increase the number of wheelchair accessible options is paying off|” BACP Commissioner Samantha Fields said. “The City of Chicago will always remain committed to working with industry to ensure robust service to members of the disability community.”“Chicago is leading the way to create more accessible transportation options for people with disabilities|” MOPD Commissioner Karen Tamley said. “The disability community will soon be able to rely on both taxis and rideshare companies for wheelchair-accessible transportation service.”In 2016| Mayor Emanuel and the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP) announced that Open Doors Organization had been selected after a competitive bidding process to provide centralized wheelchair-accessible taxicab dispatch service to passengers across Chicago. The move further improves services for people with disabilities and increases safe and reliable transportation options for people who use wheelchairs. In 2017| nearly 29|000 trips have been taken through Open Doors year-to-date. More than 63|000 trips were taken through Open Doors in 2016| up from over 34|000 trips provided in 2015. Recent data from taxis and rideshare companies showed that trips throughout Chicago reached record highs in 2016.In 2016 the total number of trips from the taxi and TNP industries was approximately 77.5 million. This amounts to a 287 percent increase over 2013| when the total number of trips was approximately 27 million.In November 2015| the City of Chicago authorized licensed TNP pick-ups at the airports. This resulted in more choice for consumers and more trips provided. In 2016 alone| approximately 8.6 million airport trips were provided by the taxi and rideshare industries combined compared to approximately 6.3 million in 2015.Additionally| over the past several years| Chicago has witnessed significant change in the ground transportation industry. More than 80 percent of taxis are now alternative fuel or fuel-efficient vehicles| the number of wheelchair-accessible taxis has more than doubled since 2011| and residents have access to universal taxi app service. BACP oversees the licensing of Chicago’s public chauffeurs and public vehicles including TNPs| taxicabs| liveries| charter and site seeing buses| horse drawn carriages| ambulances| water taxis and tour boats. The department also oversees the purchasing of taxicab medallions| vehicle inspections and rates of fare. Learn more about BACP’s at www.cityofchicago.org/BACP.,May 8| 2017
853,Mayor Emanuel Announces EPA Climate Change Information Now on City Website,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced the creation of a City of Chicago “Climate Change is Real” website| putting information from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Climate Change Website on the City of Chicago’s servers after the Trump administration unceremoniously removed it from the federal government’s websites on April 29. The new site| www.cityofchicago.org/climatechangeisreal| ensures the public has ready access to information the EPA has developed over decades of research to inform the public about the impact of climate change. Mayor Emanuel is calling on other U.S. Mayors to follow suit. “The Trump administration can attempt to erase decades of work from scientists and federal employees on the reality of climate change| but burying your head in the sand doesn’t erase the problem|” Mayor Emanuel said.  “We are going to ensure Chicago’s residents remain well informed about the effects of climate change| and I encourage cities| academic institutions| and others to voice concerns to follow suit to ensure this important information does not disappear.”The new website includes information on the basic science behind climate change| the different ways in which weather is impacted from increased greenhouse had emissions| and actions the federal government has taken to reduce the impact.  “Cities are becoming central in the climate fight. In the absence of federal leadership| this is a key moment for local action|” Henry Henderson| Midwest Director for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)| said. “Chicago has long been a clean energy leader and is now stepping up to help defend the nation against the seeming war on climate science underway in DC.” The Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT) has released a new tool so that the City and the public as a whole can easily save| archive and preserve open data from public data portals| such as the EPA site.“We will not allow this data to simply be taken away from us|” Chief Data Officer Tom Schenk| Jr. said. “We will create and share the tools so we can continue to understand the risks climate change has for us and to combat it together.” Today’s announcement builds on Mayor Emanuel’s strong environmental track record since 2011. In January| Mayor Emanuel announced that Chicago has reduced its carbon emissions by seven percent from 2010 to 2015 all while the region’s economy grew 12 percent. The emissions reduction| equivalent to shutting down a coal power plant for eight months| compares to a one percent increase in nationwide emissions from 2009 to 2014. On April 9| the Mayor announced that by 2025 all of Chicago’s public buildings will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. That transition means that 8 percent of the city-wide electricity load or 1.8 billion kilowatt hours will come from clean and renewable sources. This follows the 2013 commitment that the City made to eliminating coal from its electricity supply.   On April 26| the City of Chicago was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2017 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award. The award is given annually to honor organizations that have made outstanding contributions to protecting the environment through energy efficiency and recognized the Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenge and its 76 member buildings covering 51.3 million square feet-all of which have committed to reducing their energy use by 20 percent. The award also recognized the four years of successful implementation of the City’s Energy Benchmarking Ordinance which has reduced energy use by 4 percent in buildings covered by the ordinance. In March| the Mayor announced that the Smart Lighting Project will start on the South and West Sides this summer. Once approved by City Council| the Chicago Smart Lighting Project will replace 270|000 of Chicago’s light fixtures and add a management system that will give the city a state-of-the-art smart lighting grid. Under Mayor Emanuel’s leadership| Chicago’s reduction in waste has a played a significant role in improving the City’s environment.  From 2010 to 2015 Chicago’s carbon emissions from waste were down 30 percent| with the expansion of the City’s recycling program playing a significant factor.  During those give years the City increased the numbers of tons of recycled material from 58|000 to 97|000. And just last week the Mayor announced that since implementation of the City’s check-out bag tax in February| residents have reduced their plastic bag use by 40 percent. The Mayor’s leadership on issues of climate change and sustainability is clear and Chicago will continue to take action.,May 7| 2017

Traditional library programs| such as book clubs and educational and cultural programming will also be offered| as well as computer classes and one-on-one coaching to build digital literacy| technology and job-seeking skills for adults and seniors.“With all new and developments moving forward throughout the Near West Side| residents have repeatedly identified a library as an important amenity for their families|” Alderman Burnett said. On the Near North Side| work is being planned on a new| state-of-the-art Engine Co. 42 fire station at the base of a new mixed-use tower in the heart of River North. Both projects will be subject to standard review and approval procedures involving the community| the Chicago Plan Commission and City Council.Planned by developer Friedman Properties Ltd.| the new station would rise immediately west of the existing Engine Co. 42 station at 55 W. Illinois St. After the new station is completed| work would begin to replace the old station with up to 614|000 square feet of office and mixed-use space.The cost of the $20.2 million fire house would be paid for by Friedman Properties. Friedman would also pay the City $5 million for the 14|600-square-foot firehouse property and an adjacent| 3|150-square-foot alley.  Terms of the proposed deal structure will be posted on DPD’s website and alternative bids will be considered for a 30 day period.“This project has the potential to be a unique partnership that could enhance a prime development location while providing a new home for Chicago’s bravest|” Ald. Reilly said. “I look forward to working through the community engagement process to see if we can make this concept a reality at no cost to our taxpayers.”The tower| to be designed by DLR Group| could include an approximately $10 million voluntary contribution toward the City’s Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus system| which supports commercial development in underserved neighborhoods| city landmarks| and local infrastructure. “The Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus system is key tool in leveraging private investment toward important neighborhood projects that directly benefit the public and create resources for communities that need them|” said Department of Planning and Development Commissioner David Reifman.The site is currently zoned Downtown Mixed-use (DX-7)| and the City expects to receive about $4.4 million in real estate taxes annually for the new development. The existing station| built in 1968| also houses the Fire Department’s Fire Prevention Bureau. The new firehouse will offer variety of modern amenities as well as a community room to engage residents and a training room for the Fire Prevention Bureau| among other upgrades.The projects reflect Mayor Emanuel’s commitment to improve local neighborhoods through innovative public-private partnerships. In February| the Mayor announced the City’s Department of Fleet and Facility Management (2FM) headquarters would be relocated from 1685 N. Throop St. in West Town to Wentworth Avenue and 69th Street in Englewood| along with 200 jobs. The purchaser of the 18-acre Throop location would also build the new 2FM facility as part of the purchase agreement. The bid process is being coordinated by Cushman & Wakefield.,April 28| 2017

865,Statement from Mayor Emanuel,“The Trump administration’s attempt to coerce cities to choose between our most basic values and federal funding was not only bad public policy| we now have further proof that it was unconstitutional. The City of Chicago was proud to sign on to an amicus brief in support of an immediate injunction| and I commend Judge Orrick’s thoughtful decision to block enforcement of this illegal executive order. Throughout our history immigrants| refugees and dreamers from around the world have moved our country and our city forward| and we will not sit idly by while President Trump threatens American cities because he doesn't share our values.”,April 25| 2017

Despite a discriminatory state funding formula that treats Chicago students as second-class citizens| and a governor who has not introduced a balanced budget in over two years while wreaking havoc on education funding from Pre-K to college| Chicago schools and students continue to beat the odds and break new records every year. CPS students| teachers| principals and families deserve tremendous credit for their hard work| talent and unwavering commitment to academic success.”,April 25| 2017

870,Mayor Emanuel| Mayor De Blasio| Mayor Garcetti| Mayor Kenney and Mayor Walsh File New Legal Briefs Against President Trump's Travel Ban As Court Cases Proceed,Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel| New York Mayor Bill de Blasio| Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti| Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh today announced the Cities of Chicago| New York City| Los Angeles| Philadelphia| Boston and 27 other cities and counties have filed additional legal briefs supporting two challenges to President Donald Trump’s efforts to restrict travel to the United States from six majority-Muslim nations and to suspend the refugee program.“Restricting travel to the United States based on religion is illegal| unconstitutional and contrary to our most fundamental American values|” said Mayor Emanuel. “Chicago is proud to stand with cities and counties across the country in defense of our most cherished principles and opposition to President’s Trump’s ill-conceived and discriminatory travel ban.”Today| Chicago led a total of 32 cities and counties on a friend-of-the-court (amicus) brief in support of the State of Hawaii and a doctor of Egyptian descent| where the district court enjoined two provisions of the Executive Order| both the President’s travel ban for individuals from certain Muslim-majority countries and the suspension of the admission of refugees into the United States. The case will be heard by a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on May 15.On Wednesday| April 19| a total of 31 cities and counties filed an amicus brief in support of the Maryland district court’s decision enjoining a provision of the President’s Executive Order on travel by individuals from certain Muslim-majority countries. The case will be heard en banc by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals on May 8 before all 15 judges.“Once again| New York City stands firmly against the White House’s exclusionary policies|” said New York City Mayor de Blasio. “Immigrants are an essential part of our city – from the local economy to civic and cultural life. Not only is this policy discriminatory| it makes us all less safe by undermining trust with law enforcement and making immigrants more vulnerable to victimization. By targeting individuals from Muslim-majority nations| this order is also a refutation of our nation’s historic commitment to be a home of refuge for those fleeing violence. New York| in partnership with cities across America| will keep fighting misguided and dangerous policies that are an affront to our morals.”“Philadelphia is again proud to voice its opposition to this discriminatory travel ban| which goes against the fundamentals of our Constitution and promotes fear among our immigrant populations|” said Philadelphia Mayor Kenney. “Along with our fellow cities and counties| we will take every opportunity to make our voices heard in this fight.”“We know immigrants and their families play a vital role in our economy| culture and overall identity| and this travel ban goes against the very bedrock of our nation|" said Boston Mayor Walsh. "The United States is rooted in the freedom to practice one's faith| and I am proud to stand with my fellow mayors as we continue to welcome people from all countries| regardless of their religion." Chicago| New York City| Los Angeles| Philadelphia and Boston| joined by Austin| Carrboro| Central Falls (RI)| Chapel Hill| Cook County| Gary| Iowa City| Ithaca| Jersey City| Madison| Minneapolis| Montgomery County (MD)| Oakland| Portland| Providence| St. Louis| St. Paul| San Francisco| Santa Clara County| Santa Monica| Seattle| Skokie| South Bend and West Hollywood| presented the local government position to the two federal courts. Both briefs explain the vital contribution that immigrants make to our cities and country| points out that classifications based on religion and natural origin are presumptively invalid| and argues that the travel ban is misguided and unconstitutional. Further| the briefs argue that cities and counties serve as gateways for immigrants and refugees starting new lives in America| and that the President’s executive order endangers communities; undermines national security; limits the labor pool; decreases tax revenues; dampens tourism industries; and harms businesses| educational institutions and hospitals. The City and County of Honolulu also joined the brief in the Ninth Circuit.Earlier this year| President Trump issued an executive order| followed by a revised executive order| restricting immigration by prohibiting people from six countries—Iran| Libya| Somalia| Sudan| Syria and Yemen—from entering the U.S. for 90 days and halting the admission into the United States of people granted refugee status for 120 days.Today’s filing in the Ninth Circuit is the fourth time Chicago| New York| Los Angeles| Philadelphia| Boston and other cities and counties have taken legal action against President Trump’s attempts to restrict travel into the United States. The court is reviewing a decision by the district court in Hawaii that relied on Chicago’s brief.The City’s brief was prepared with the pro bono assistance of several attorneys of the law firm Riley Safer Holmes & Cancila LLP| which has offices in Chicago| New York and San Francisco.  “The City is grateful for Riley Safer’s contribution to our efforts to protect the rights of immigrants and refugees and to defend Chicago’s status as a city that embraces diversity and promotes inclusion|” said Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel.The recent legal action is one of several actions the Emanuel Administration has taken since the November election to reiterate Chicago’s status as a welcoming City.Among these| to provide legal assistance to vulnerable Chicago residents| the city created a Legal Protection Fund| pledging $1.3 million to the fund to integrate legal support from attorneys with community navigators rooted in Chicago's many ethnic communities to provide outreach| education and assistance to immigrant families across Chicago.On December 7| Mayor Emanuel presented a letter to President-elect Donald Trump urging him to continue the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program until Congress modernizes the immigration system and provides a more permanent form of relief for the over one million young people who were brought to the U.S. before they were 16 and are eligible for the program.Mayor Emanuel| U.S. Senator Dick Durbin and Congressman Luis Gutierrez also launched a new “Chicago is With You” task force that is collaborating on mental health| legal services| employer communications| and education policies to ensure the City is delivering comprehensive services to immigrants| refugees and other disenfranchised communities.Since taking office| Mayor Emanuel has launched a series of initiatives that improve the immigrant community’s access to services| expand new and existing immigrant businesses| and welcome and celebrate Chicago’s diverse immigrant communities. These initiatives include launching the Cities for Citizenship Campaign with the Mayors of New York City and Los Angeles| which has grown into a bipartisan effort which works with 30 city and county leaders across America.,April 21| 2017
871,Mayor Emanuel and CTA Announce Renovation Work to Begin at Historic Quincy Station,Mayor Rahm Emanuel and CTA President Dorval R. Carter| Jr today announced the start of a major project to renovate the historic Quincy Loop station and make the 120-year-old station fully wheelchair accessible| while preserving its renowned historic appearance. “The renovation of the historic Quincy station is the next step on the path to ensuring every CTA station in Chicago is accessible to every resident of Chicago|” said Mayor Emanuel. “In neighborhoods across the city we are reconstructing and reimagining the CTA with unprecedented new investments| and today we are undertaking another project that will benefit Chicagoans for generations to come.”   Among the improvements| the Quincy station will receive two new elevators located on the inbound and outbound platforms to make the station accessible to customers with disabilities. This upgrade will increase the number of Loop stations that are fully accessible to customers.  “Serving Chicago for more than 100 years| the Quincy ‘L’ station provides convenient access to and from Chicago’s downtown Loop|” said CTA President Dorval R. Carter. “By adding elevators and other enhancements| Quincy will be ready to serve 21st century riders while retaining its unique historical charm.” The accessibility improvements are another step in CTA’s push toward 100 percent accessibility across CTA| a goal set by President Carter’s All Stations Accessibility Program. Additional improvements include stair replacement| painting and lighting upgrades. The mezzanine-level ceiling will be enhanced with new| historic-style aluminum panels| while new light fixtures will be installed to complement the station’s original features. In keeping with the station’s turn-of-the-century look| the elevator tower exteriors will feature a pattern referencing the one present on the station’s historic railings.            Various elements of the original historic station| which opened when U.S. President William McKinley was in office| remain today—including pressed metal wreaths and fluted pilasters| or decorative columns| located on the stationhouse façade. Much of the station’s appearance has been restored over the years while retaining its historical character. This includes the ticket agent’s booth| which was faithfully replicated in the 1980s based on original 1897 plans and is still in use today. The $18.2 million project is the largest renovation in nearly 30 years for Quincy| which was built in 1897 and is one of CTA’s oldest rail stations.  Last renovated in 1988| Quincy station serves more than 2.2 million riders annually via the Brown| Orange| Pink and Purple lines and is a major transfer point for 10 CTA bus routes| Union Station and the LaSalle Street Metra Station. The project is the latest in a series of transit investments by Mayor Emanuel to improve transit in the downtown Loop| including:•    Washington/Wabash| $75M| opens Summer 2017•    Union Station Transit Center| $43M| opened 2016•    Loop Link| $32M| opened 2015•    Harrison Station Renovation| $10M| completed in 2014•    Loop Track Renewal| $53M| completed in 2013 The project is expected to be completed by the end of the year. For more information about Quincy station and this renovation project| please visit: http://www.transitchicago.com/quincy/.Since 2011| Mayor Emanuel and CTA have announced| begun or completed more than $8 billion of transit improvements projects to build a 21st century| world-class transit system. The wide-ranging investments include about 40 new and renovated CTA rail stations| track and rail infrastructure upgrades| new trains and buses| technology investments including installing 4G wireless service in all subways and installing unique public artwork in CTA stations across the city.,April 21| 2017
872,Mayor Emanuel Announces New Program Aimed at Housing 100 Homeless Families,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today launched the Housing Homeless Families program| an unprecedented joint initiative with the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless (the Coalition) and its HomeWorks Campaign to address homelessness impacting families in the most at-risk communities. Using funds derived by the City of Chicago’s surcharge on the house sharing industry| the City will work with the Coalition to connect 100 homeless families in high crime communities with permanent housing. To secure housing for those families identified| the City will create 100 new permanent supportive housing units. “Around the city| children should be able to focus on their studies| and not where they are going to sleep at night|”  said Mayor Emanuel. “Working with our partners at the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless on this new initiative| we will work to ensure that more families experiencing or on the verge of homelessness can find and maintain the housing and stability they need to thrive and provide for their children.” Beginning this summer| the Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS) and the Coalition| along with lead project partner| CSH| will launch the first phase of this effort to identify families currently experiencing homelessness or who have touched the homeless shelter system in recent months| focusing on those with school-aged children. The second phase will include placement of the eligible families into 100 new permanent supportive housing units to be added by the Chicago Low Income Housing Trust Fund.“We are thrilled that the city is committing a new resource for housing for homeless families|” said Doug Schenkelberg| Executive Director of Chicago Coalition for the Homeless| “and in particular that they are recognizing the needs of the highly vulnerable doubled-up households that have not been able to receive housing and services previously.” Because families that are homeless are at a significantly higher risk for experiencing violence| the City and the Coalition will focus on communities experiencing some of the city’s highest rates of violence| including: Austin| Humboldt Park| West Englewood| and Englewood. Together| the City and the Coalition will identify families by working closely with shelters specializing in family services| and with Chicago Public Schools (CPS) to assess families of schools with a higher concentration of homeless students to select them for housing. “The goal of this initiative is to help our most vulnerable families to establish stability so that their children can succeed|” said DFSS Commissioner Lisa Morrison Butler. "Thanks to collaboration with our partners at the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless| the city will deliver a coordinated response to ensure the needs of our most vulnerable families are met| and to prevent families on the cusp from experiencing homelessness.”  The initiative will enlist feedback from designated shelters in the key community areas| placing priority on families with students attending schools in the area. These schools include: Ellington ES| Nicholson ES| Earle ES| Ward ES| Howe ES| and Lowell ES.  Once families are identified for the program| they will receive housing vouchers| and will be matched to a housing provider who will help them locate housing and ensure a smooth transition. Families will continue to work with these providers as they receive wraparound services to support them in maintaining permanent housing. Families will also receive support by housing navigators in getting to appointments and obtaining required documents for housing applications.  The matching and transition process will be led by CSH using best practices based on implementation of the city's emerging coordinated entry system for homeless service and housing| a vital ingredient to the success of similar initiatives focusing on housing Veterans and Chronically homeless residents. The Housing Homeless Families initiative was borne out of a yearlong planning process led by the City and with input by the Coalition| and draws upon lessons derived through the Ending Veterans Homeless Initiative and the Chronic Homeless Pilot programs| which use the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) to leverage “real-time” data to identify where the most vulnerable families are| and to allocate resources for families and individuals experiencing homelessness based on where the immediate needs are. The initiative will be funded in part by a $1 million investment by the Chicago Low Income Housing Trust Fund (CLIHF)| with matched funds via the City’s house sharing revenue stream. Last year| the Chicago City Council enacted an unprecedented four percent surcharge on the house sharing industry| making Chicago among the first municipalities to leverage a dedicated funding source for homelessness.  To date| the city has allocated more than $500|000 in funding for homelessness reduction| serving approximately 150 homeless individuals. Since taking office| Mayor Emanuel has made addressing homelessness a key priority. In addition to a 5-year commitment to create more affordable housing| the Emanuel Administration has launched several innovative programs with a focus on reducing homelessness| including: participation in the national EVHI campaign helping to house more than 3|000 homeless Veterans to date; creation of a new day labor program to employ and offer services to more than 500 panhandlers; and a significant expansion of affordable housing which has created or preserved more than 38|000 affordable units since 2011.,April 20| 2017

877,Mayor Emanuel Launches New Open Data Portal,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today launched a new| redesigned open data portal to help residents better navigate City information and use it in everyday life. For example| sidewalk café permits will now be available on the portal| creating a one-stop resource for outdoor dining locations in the City. “We are making open city government data more accessible so everyone can learn more about where they live and work|” Mayor Emanuel said. “The new data portal will help residents and visitors in ways big and small| like allowing them to discover outdoor restaurant options through better access to sidewalk café permits. This is another example of our continued efforts to make data available| but also relevant to Chicagoans in unique ways.” In addition to searching all businesses licensing data already available| patrons can now see a dataset of restaurants and bars with sidewalk café permits. To date| there are more than 500 sidewalk café permits within the City. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis| with new permits added daily as they are approved. The open data portal promotes transparency by making raw City data available to the public. It contains over 600 data sets and receives more than 80|000 visits per month| with nearly one million visits in 2016. The redesigned website makes it easier for all Chicagoans to find facts| maps| and data about Chicago| such as restaurant inspections| business licenses| and taxi trips. The updated data portal has several new features| including a new home page that highlights relevant information and apps| redesigned data pages that provide context for each dataset| updated exploration tools that allow you to create charts and maps more easily| and video tutorials. Mobile device users will also be able to seamlessly use the redesigned portal on smartphones and tablets. Thirty percent of open data portal visitors are using mobile devices| with that number expected to rise. Research conducted by the Arizona State University and University of Iowa in conjunction with the City of Chicago has shown Chicagoans in low-income areas without home broadband connectivity are more likely to use mobile devices to access city services| such as the data portal| underscoring the importance of mobile accessibility. The redesigned open data portal was released as a beta in September 2016 to get feedback from residents. The City partnered with Smart Chicago Collaborative to host a user-feedback session at Woodson Regional Library. The City also hosted feedback sessions with software developers and user experience experts to elicit feedback from a broad audience. Numerous adjustments were made based on feedback from residents and will continue to optimize the experience for all. “Chicago was one of the earliest adopters of open data portals| and is an important part of Chicago’s strategy to be a smarter city|” Chief Data Officer Tom Schenk said. “City of Chicago staff have also leveraged data from the data portal to make better| more informed decisions.” Chicago’s investment in open data through strategic partnerships with civic tech volunteers and startups| has also helped improve city services. By making more and more data accessible| the City has facilitated the development of numerous innovative civic applications by independent developers| such as: • Chicago Works| which allows residents to make service requests to 311 and track issues as they are addressed.• Wasmycartowed.com| which lets users look up their car by license plate| make| or model and find out if it has been towed or relocated.• Mind My Business| which is an iOS and Android app that provides alerts to small business on construction| traffic| 311| inspections| and other data so they can make more informed decisions to save money and create opportunities.• SweepAround.us| which allows users to input their address and register for text or e-mail alerts for a reminder when their street will be swept so they can move their vehicle. Chicago’s open data portal has also provided a platform to build the city’s data-driven approach to improving operations. In 2015| Chicago launched a predictive food inspection process using data from the open data portal. The model helps the City of Chicago’s health inspectors prioritize their annual inspections of nearly 16|000 food establishments to ensure food safety. Leveraging the data updated daily on the portal| the predictive analytics model has increased the efficiency of city health inspectors by 25 percent| and landed the city a Top 25 Bright Idea award from Harvard University for innovation in government.

880,Mayor Emanuel Announces Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenge Hits 50 Million Square Feet,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced that the Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenge has now exceeded 50 million square feet with 14 additional buildings having joined the Challenge since July 2016. One of the largest voluntary energy efficiency programs in the country| the program now boasts 76 buildings and 51.3 million square feet participating. “From Rogers Park to Trumbull Park big buildings around the City are showing they can work together to reduce emissions| save money and put people to work|” Mayor Emanuel said. “The 76 buildings participating send a clear signal around the country| especially Washington| that Chicago will continue to lead the way in sustainability.” The new participants include six affordable housing properties owned by the Chicago Housing Authority and one new house of worship| reflecting the widening scope of the program. One-half the Challenge’s new participants| and over one-quarter of participants in total| sit outside the Central Business District. Through 2015| Chicago Energy Challenge participants have saved 90 million kilowatt-hours per year| representing 70|000 metric tons in avoided greenhouse gas emissions - equivalent to removing 14|000 cars from the road. “We are proud to partner with Retrofit Chicago to bring energy efficiency best practices to buildings throughout all of Chicago’s neighborhoods|” said Katie Kaluzny| Associate Director of the U.S. Green Building Council – Illinois Chapter. “We look forward to continued partnerships with Mayor Emanuel| the Chicago Housing Authority and others within the challenge to provide volunteer mentors and educational programming to help everyone reach their energy efficiency goals in the coming years.” The efforts of the Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenged have been bolstered by The Chicago Energy Benchmarking ordinance| which increases awareness and transparency of energy use in large buildings. Together| these properties have achieved estimated energy savings of $17.6 million per year. The next compliance period ends on June 1| 2017. “MB Real Estate is a proud supporter of Mayor Emanuel’s Retrofit Chicago Energy Challenge|” said Suzanne Hendrick| Senior Vice President and Director of Asset Management for MB Real Estate. “We have seven properties participating in the Energy Challenge with 333 North Michigan and 30 West Monroe recently reaching the 20% energy savings milestone. One North LaSalle| 55 West Wacker| and The Chicago Bar Association have recently committed to The Challenge and look forward to a successful 2017. In keeping with the Mayor’s goal of making Chicago the most affordable| competitive and sustainable city of the 21st century| we strive to have all qualified buildings join the Challenge and continue to promote energy efficiency.” On Sunday| Mayor Emanuel announced the City| addition to Chicago Public Schools| Chicago Park District| Chicago Housing Authority| and City Colleges of Chicago were committing to move their buildings’ electricity use to 100 percent renewable energy by 2025. When implemented| Chicago will be the largest major city in the country to have a 100 percent renewable energy supply for its public buildings. Last week| the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced the City of Chicago earned a 2017 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award.

881,Mayor Emanuel Demands Answers from U.S. Steel| Touts Importance of EPA Following Release of Hexavalent Chromium into Lake Michigan Tributary in Indiana,Mayor Rahm Emanuel released the following statement after state and federal officials notified the City of Chicago’s Department of Water Management (DWM) that U.S. Steel Corporation released hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) into Burns Waterway| a Lake Michigan tributary| located near their facility in Portage| Indiana on Tuesday| April 11.,April 13| 2017
882,Mayor Emanuel Reaffirms City of Chicago's Ban on Travel to North Carolina Due to Discriminatory Law,Mayor Rahm Emanuel today reaffirmed the City of Chicago’s commitment to preventing discrimination against any and all groups by announcing that a policy barring travel to North Carolina will remain intact| despite recent action by the state to amend its bathroom policy. Just over a year ago| Mayor Emanuel issued the original ban on non-essential travel to North Carolina to renounce the discriminatory impact that the state’s bathroom policy placed against transgender individuals. While the state recently adapted the original bill barring transgender individuals from using the bathrooms consistent with how they identify| this measure does not go far enough in protecting the rights of the broader LGBTQ community. As a result| a new resolution will be brought forth at the monthly City Council meeting next week to affirm that the current restriction on travel to North Carolina for city business remains in place. “As a welcoming city for all| we are clear on our values of tolerance and inclusion| and we won’t stand by idly when discriminatory policies threaten the rights of any single group or community|” said Mayor Emanuel. “Until North Carolina acknowledges the rights of the LGBTQ community and treats all individuals fairly| the City of Chicago will be taking our business elsewhere| and we encourage others to do the same.” Mayor Emanuel doubled down on the City’s original 2016 ban of non-essential travel to North Carolina because the state's recent actions to amend its bathroom policy do not explicitly account for the rights of the broader LGBTQ community. Specifically| recent measures prevent local governments and municipalities in the state from passing their own local anti-discrimination laws and replace HB2's discriminatory| anti-transgender bathroom regulations with new regulations that continue to make it difficult for transgender people to access restrooms consistent with their gender identity.  “Today’s pledge by Mayor Emanuel to uphold the travel ban to North Carolina demonstrates that Chicago remains committed to protecting all groups from discrimination|” said Mona Noriega| Chair and Commissioner of the Commission on Human Relations. “We have made so much progress toward improving inclusion of LGBTQ individuals in recent years| and this action makes clear that Chicago stands up for the rights of all individuals and against discrimination in any form.” Last year| the administration took swift action in response to the passage of a North Carolina law which prohibited local governments from passing laws to protect members of the LGBTQ community| directing City department heads to restrict any City-funded or other travel by an employee representing the City of Chicago to the State of North Carolina. Since then| Chicago has ceased authorizing new travel to the state in conducting city business| except for in rare instances of contractual agreements and those required to enforce Chicago law. “Today’s commitment by Mayor Emanuel shows that Chicago will not tolerate discrimination|” said 44th Ward Alderman and LGBT Caucus chair| Tom Tunney. “While it’s unfortunate that discriminatory practices are being upheld by the State of North Carolina| the City Council stands with people regardless of sexuality or gender identity| and is steadfastly committed to ensuring Chicago remains a haven for all people.” This is just the latest action taken by the Mayor to combat discrimination against LGBTQ and transgender individuals. Since 2011| a series of policies have been implemented to secure the overall inclusion and rights of the LGBTQ community and to prevent discrimination throughout the city of Chicago. These include the city’s own bathroom protection policy and landmark transgender health care reforms.,April 13| 2017

Since that time| the program has grown to include partnerships with 15 Chicagoland colleges and universities to enable Star Scholars to continue their college education at a four-year university. CME Group joins the movement to ensure Star Scholars can continue with four-year opportunities this spring by providing 25 two-year scholarships valued at $5|000.

A select number of scholars will also be chosen to receive a summer internship at CME Group member clearing firms.
